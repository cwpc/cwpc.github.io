		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-111.jpg"></br><p>A strong upward trend in prison population undermined both <a class="otx-link" title="Prisons&#8217; Means for Suppressing Prisoners&#8217; Communication" href="http://cwpc.github.io/suppressing-communication-auburn-eastern-penitentiary/?otxkey=post-933">congregate and separate prison-discipline systems</a>. Both the congregate and separate systems required one cell per prisoner. However, the political process that determines prison population and the political process that funds prison construction are not tightly connected. Adding prison cells usually occurs in sizable increments (building new prisons). The political return to building unoccupied prison cells is low. With rising prison populations, prisons are thus continually overcrowded.<a class="otx-link" title="Bleich-1989 The Politics of Prison Crowding" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/bleich-1989-the-politics-of-prison-crowding/?otxkey=Bleich-1989&#038;otxrp=pp.+1144%2C+1149">^</a> Prison overcrowding typically implies housing more than one prisoner per cell.</p>
<p>U.S. penitentiaries built to have one prisoner per cell did not limited cells to one prisoner for long. In 1827, a survey of pioneering U.S. penitentiaries observed:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some time after their commencement, these establishments appear to have answered every purpose which their promoters had in view. But as from various causes a relaxation of discipline took place, and as from the rapid increase in the population of every part of the United States, a great influx of prisoners was occasioned, the buildings became inadequate to their reception, or at least to afford that secluded accommodation, which is indispensable to their utility.<a class="otx-link" title="Bulfinch-1827 Report of Charles Bulfinch on the Subject of Penitentiaries," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/bulfinch-1827-report-of-charles-bulfinch-on-the-subject-of-penitentiaries/?otxkey=Bulfinch-1827&#038;otxrp=pp.+4-5">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Penitentiaries in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York City, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia in 1827 were holding more than one prisoner in a cell, in most cases more than two.<a class="otx-link" title="Bulfinch-1827 Report of Charles Bulfinch on the Subject of Penitentiaries," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/bulfinch-1827-report-of-charles-bulfinch-on-the-subject-of-penitentiaries/?otxkey=Bulfinch-1827&#038;otxrp=p.+5+%28provides+range+for+each+penitentiary%29">^</a> From 1850 to 1890, the <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoners in the U.S. from 1850" href="http://cwpc.github.io/datasets/prisoners-us-long-run-summary/?otxkey=datasets-prisoners-us-long-run-summary">number of prisoners in the U.S.</a> grew sixfold. The deliberative consensus in favor of having one prisoner per cell did not enduringly change the institutional determinants of prison population and prison construction. Growth in the number of prisoners over time inevitably led to more than one prisoner per cell.</p>
<p>Auburn Prison housed more than one prisoner per cell soon after it became the exemplar of the <a class="otx-link" title="Prisons&#8217; Means for Suppressing Prisoners&#8217; Communication" href="http://cwpc.github.io/suppressing-communication-auburn-eastern-penitentiary/?otxkey=post-933">congregate (Auburn) system of suppressing prisoners&#8217; communication</a>. Auburn Prison pioneered the Auburn system in 1823. By 1831, its prisoner population exceeded its cells by about one hundred. The warden of Auburn Prison then noted, “discipline in this prison has suffered, and is suffering, from the necessary contact, in many cases, of two convicts in the same dormitory.” The warden pleaded for funding for an expansion of his prison. He eventually received funding to construct additional cells.<a class="otx-link" title="NYAuburn AR1831 Annual Report of the Inspectors of the State Prison" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/nyauburn-ar1831-annual-report-of-the-inspectors-of-the-state-prison/?otxkey=NYAuburn+AR1831&#038;otxrp=Warden%E2%80%99s+Report%2C+pp.+3-4">^</a></p>
<p>Pennsylvania state prisons, exemplars of the <a class="otx-link" title="Prisons&#8217; Means for Suppressing Prisoners&#8217; Communication" href="http://cwpc.github.io/suppressing-communication-auburn-eastern-penitentiary/?otxkey=post-933">Pennsylvania system of suppressing prisoners&#8217; communication</a>, similarly did not for long maintain separate cells for prisoners. Pennsylvania&#8217;s Eastern State Penitentiary began operation in 1829. By 1833, it had more prisoners than cells.<a class="otx-link" title="Johnston-1994 Eastern State Penitentiary : crucible of good inte" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/johnston-1994-eastern-state-penitentiary-crucible-of-good-inte/?otxkey=Johnston-1994&#038;otxrp=pp.+50%2C+84+%28chart+of+cells+and+population%2C+1829-1971%29">^</a> More cells were built, but the number of prisoners continued to rise. In 1866, Eastern State had twenty-nine more prisoners than cells. By 1881, only 435 out of 1025 convicts in Eastern State were confined separately. Pennsylvania&#8217;s Western State Penitentiary, which less successfully implemented the Pennsylvania system, had by 1861 eighty-one more prisoners than cells.<a class="otx-link" title="Barnes-1927 The evolution of penology in Pennsylvania: a study" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/barnes-1927-the-evolution-of-penology-in-pennsylvania-a-study/?otxkey=Barnes-1927&#038;otxrp=p.+299%2C+ft.+258%3B+p.+307">^</a></p>
<p>Growth in prison populations similarly undermined one prisoner per cell at other prisons. New Jersey implemented the separate system in 1836. In 1852, thirty cells in the New Jersey State Prison housed more than one prisoner.<a class="otx-link" title="NJPRA AR3 Third Annual Report of the New Jersey Prison Reform" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/njpra-ar3-third-annual-report-of-the-new-jersey-prison-reform/?otxkey=NJPRA+AR3&#038;otxrp=p.+5">^</a> In 1859, the New Jersey legislature reported, “The prison is now so full that the system of solitary confinement is, in practice, disregarded, many cells having two or more prisoners.”<a class="otx-link" title="Wines-1867 Report on the prisons and reformatories of the United" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/wines-1867-report-on-the-prisons-and-reformatories-of-the-united/?otxkey=Wines-1867&#038;otxrp=p.+53+%28quoting+Legislature%29">^</a> In 1873, at least sixteen state prisons in the U.S. had <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoners Per Cell in U.S. State Prisons, 1868-1873" href="http://cwpc.github.io/datasets/state-prisons-cells-prisoners-1868-1873/?otxkey=datasets-state-prisons-cells-prisoners-1868-1873">more than one prisoner per cell</a>.</p>
<p>Both the Auburn system (the congregate/silent system) and the Pennsylvania system (the separate system) in principle imposed absolute silence on prisoners. A survey of state prisons in the U.S. and Canada in 1866 found that, except in four state prisons, “absolute and unbroken silence is the {formal} rule.”<a class="otx-link" title="Wines-1867 Report on the prisons and reformatories of the United" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/wines-1867-report-on-the-prisons-and-reformatories-of-the-united/?otxkey=Wines-1867&#038;otxrp=p.+175">^</a> As late as 1937 in the Iowa State Prison in Fort Madison, inmate rules required that an inmate observe “strict silence” in his cell, in the Cell House, Hospital, Dining Room, and while marching through the yard. The rules stated, “Communication between prisoners is strictly prohibited except by permission of the officer in charge.”<a class="otx-link" title="Runyon-1953 In for life, a convict’s story" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/runyon-1953-in-for-life-a-convicts-story/?otxkey=Runyon-1953&#038;otxrp=pp.+64-5">^</a></p>
<p>Prisoners who share a cell cannot realistically be prevented from communicating with each other. Having more than one prisoner per cell made a rule of absolute silence impossible in practice. A survey of state prisons in 1866 found that the rule of silence often was not enforced: “Communication, then, we must believe, takes place among convicts continually, and, in most prisons, to a very great extent.”<a class="otx-link" title="Wines-1867 Report on the prisons and reformatories of the United" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/wines-1867-report-on-the-prisons-and-reformatories-of-the-united/?otxkey=Wines-1867&#038;otxrp=p.+177%3B+see+also+pp.+50%2C+56">^</a> From early on, prison population growth that exceeded prison cell construction undermined in practice the <a class="otx-link" title="Transnational Consensus Supported Suppressing Prisoners&#8217; Communication" href="http://cwpc.github.io/transnational-consensus-supports-suppressing-prisoners-communication/?otxkey=post-960">deliberative consensus to suppress prisoners’ communication</a>.</p>

		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-181.jpg"></br><p>From the 1830s, communication between prisoners and family and friends increased through low-profile, local changes in prison rules. Penal reformers early in the nineteenth century were <a class="otx-link" title="Prisons’ Means for Suppressing Prisoners’ Communication" href="http://cwpc.github.io/suppressing-communication-auburn-eastern-penitentiary/?otxkey=post-933">intensely concerned about communication among prisoners</a>. Communication between prisoners and their family and friends was <a class="otx-link" title="Suppressing Prisoners’ Communication with Family and Friends" href="http://cwpc.github.io/suppressing-prisoners-communication-with-family-and-friends/?otxkey=post-4981">little discussed</a>. These latter <em>ad hoc</em> communication policies varied considerably, but over time became less restrictive. For example, New York&#8217;s Sing Sing prison in 1839 was fully suppressing prisoners’ communication with family and friends:</p>
<blockquote><p>No communications were allowed between the prisoners and their friends, neither personally nor by letter; and so thoroughly was this arrangement carried out that a convict from his commitment to his release was as completely cut off from his family as if dead<a class="otx-link" title="Luckey-1860 Life in Sing Sing State Prison, as seen in a twelve" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/luckey-1860-life-in-sing-sing-state-prison-as-seen-in-a-twelve/?otxkey=Luckey-1860&amp;otxrp=p.+18">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A new administration at Sing Sing in 1840 gave convicts the opportunity to send and receive personal letters and receive personal visits.<a class="otx-link" title="Luckey-1860 Life in Sing Sing State Prison, as seen in a twelve" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/luckey-1860-life-in-sing-sing-state-prison-as-seen-in-a-twelve/?otxkey=Luckey-1860&amp;otxrp=pp.+30-1">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Lewis-1965 From Newgate to Dannemora; the rise of the penitentiary" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/lewis-1965-from-newgate-to-dannemora-the-rise-of-the-penitentiary/?otxkey=Lewis-1965&amp;otxrp=p.+216">^</a> Another change in administration in 1843 cut off prisoners’ personal correspondence and abridged personal visiting. By 1849, prisoners at Sing Sing were again allowed to engage in personal correspondence. Prisoners at the Auburn prison and at least three other state penitentiaries similarly had such communication opportunities.<a class="otx-link" title="NYPA AR5 Fifth Annual Report of the New-York Prison Associa" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/nypa-ar5-fifth-annual-report-of-the-new-york-prison-associa/?otxkey=NYPA+AR5&amp;otxrp=pp.+186-7">^</a></p>

<p>More comprehensive evidence from the mid-nineteenth-century shows considerable communication policy variation within the common practice of permitting some communication between prisoners and their families and friends. State prisons in the U.S. about 1870 imposed no frequency restrictions on prisoners receiving letters, but writing letters and meeting with friends and family were subject to frequency restrictions. Prisoners were allowed to write one letter per month in 46% of reporting prisons (mainly state prisons) about 1870. The state prisons in Maine and Missouri allowed prisoners to write at state expense once every three months and monthly, respectively. Prisoners were permitted to write at their expense weekly in Maine and more often than monthly in Missouri. The most constraining regulation on prisoners writing letters to family and friends was one letter allowed every three months. That was the policy in 17% of U.S. state prisons about 1870.</p>
<p>In state prisons about 1870, personal visits with family and friends were permitted at a frequency of one every three months or greater. About <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoner Communication Policies in Mid-19th-Century U.S." href="http://cwpc.github.io/datasets/prisoner-communication-mid-19th-century/?otxkey=datasets-prisoner-communication-mid-19th-century">a third of reporting state prisons</a> imposed no restrictions on frequency of visits. That was similar to the typically unrestricted communication policy in jails. Lack of restrictions on visiting for some state prisons may reflect the practical difficulty of actually visiting prisoners in relatively remote prisons. While a higher share of prisons allowed unrestricted visiting compared to unrestricted letter writing, restrictions on visiting were not uniformly less stringent than restrictions on writing letters: 22% of prisons restricted personal visits to one every three months, compared to 17% doing so for letter writing. Overall, the pattern of communication liberalization across prisons and across modes of communication was disparate.</p>

<p>Liberalization of prisoners’ communication with family and friends has continued through to the present. By 1912, state prisons in 59% of U.S. states allowed prisoners to write three or more letters per month. Eight states did not restrict the number of letters that prisoners could write. Virginia, the most restrictive state, limited prisoners to writing no more than one letter every two months. Prisons in eleven states divided prisoners into different classes and regulated communication differently for the different classes of prisoners. This class-based regulation often differentiated between being allowed to write one letter per month and being allowed to write two or four letters per month. That structure of regulation suggests that such differences mattered to prisoners. Prisoners in the U.S. in 1912 typically were allowed to write letters five to ten times as frequently as they were allowed about 1870.</p>
<p>Prisoners’ opportunities to correspond and visit in person with family and friends continued to increase across the twentieth century. In 1971, 58% of U.S. state prisons allowed prisoners to send an unlimited number of letters. Among those same prisons in 1981, the share limiting letters from prisoners to less than eight per week fell from 37% to 3%. Prisoners were also allowed more frequent visits from family and friends. In 1956, U.S. prisons typically allowed family and friends to visit prisoners twice per month. Only 6% allowed at least five visits per month. In 1981, 75% of state prisons allowed at least five visits per month. By 1987, 35% of U.S. state prisons allowed prisoners to receive visits daily.

<p>Extending telephone service to prisoners was a relatively late development in the U.S. About a third of <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AnZb5H7tDMvTdGJLU2NUYm1QR1E2S1RpMTRyLWxwMnc&amp;hl=en&amp;gid=1&amp;output=html">U.S. households in 1920 had telephone service</a>. By 1970, 85% of households had telephone service. However, in 1971, all U.S. prisons surveyed did not allow prisoners to receive ordinary telephone calls. Prisoners in 86% of prisons in 1971 were not allowed to make any ordinary telephone calls. In U.S. federal prisons in the 1970s, prisoners were allowed to make one call every three months.<a class="otx-link" title="OIG-1999 Criminal Calls: A Review of the Bureau of Prisons'" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/oig-1999-criminal-calls-a-review-of-the-bureau-of-prisons/?otxkey=OIG-1999&amp;otxrp=Executive+Summary%2C+I.+Introduction">^</a> Telephone service for prisoners expanded rapidly in the 1970s. In 2005, 82% of prisons allowed prisoners to make more than three phone calls per month.</p>
<p>Administrative rules in most prisons in the U.S. today no longer directly constrain the frequency of communicating with most prisoners. In 2005, about two-thirds of prisons allowed prisoners to receive at least five visits per month. Prisoners on average actually received about three visits per month. Almost all prisons allowed prisoners to send and receive at least eight letters per week. Prisoners on average actually sent and received four letters per week.<a class="otx-link" title="Hoffmann-2007 Communication Policy Changes in State Adult Correctional" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/hoffmann-2007-communication-policy-changes-in-state-adult-correctional/?otxkey=Hoffmann-2007">^</a> Most prisons do not restrict the number of telephone calls that a prisoner can make.</p>
<p>Factors other than direct administrative rules have become the most important constraints on the frequency of prisoners&#8217; communication with their families and friends. The quantity, quality, and practice of prisoners&#8217; personal relationships affect the extent of communication through letters, visits, and telephone calls. Prisoners’ education affects their ability to communicate through letters. Travel costs and visiting arrangements affect the total cost and value of in-person visits to prisoners. Telephone calling rates and telephone use queuing affect the amount of prisoners’ telephone use. Different communication technologies such as text messaging and video conferencing offer different types of communication. The range of communication services available to prisoners affects their communication relative to communication now typical for persons not incarcerated.</p>

Prisoners typically eat together, exercise together, and work together without rules forbidding communication among prisoners. In Britain, Canada, and Scotland about 1995, more than a quarter of prisoners in non-local prisons apparently shared a sleeping space with another prisoner.<a class="otx-link" title="Robinson-1996 Summary of Findings of the 1995 CSC [Correctional" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/robinson-1996-summary-of-findings-of-the-1995-csc-correctional/?otxkey=Robinson-1996&#038;otxrp=Table+2">^</a> More detailed data for the U.S. indicates that 83% of prisoners in state and federal prisons shared a sleeping space with other prisoners in 1997. Only 17% of state and federal prisoners were housed in cells holding a single prisoner. While prisons now restrict some forms of communication, they do so for purposes of security and order, not because suppressing communication is itself a penological goal.<br />
