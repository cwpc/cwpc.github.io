		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-223.jpg"></br><p>Communication isn&#8217;t limited to public works. Public works are broadly accessible symbolic works that now compete for attention with similarly situated works. To appreciate the range of communicative structures beyond public works, consider the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It describes forms of personal communication (exercise of religion, physical assembly of persons, verbal address between persons) and forms of public communication (making laws, petitioning the government). It also refers to communication in competition for acclaim (lawmakers making laws) and communication in competition for attention (printers printing newspapers). A broad concept of media that encompasses both newspapers and telephone calls obscures important differences in communicative structure.<a class="otx-link" title="Starr-2004 The creation of the media: political origins of modern" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/starr-2004-the-creation-of-the-media-political-origins-of-modern/?otxkey=Starr-2004">^</a></p>
<p>Penal incarceration fundamentally concerns <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoners Out of Sight, Out of Mind for Public" href="http://cwpc.github.io/prisoners-out-of-sight-out-of-mind/?otxkey=post-5247">changing a person&#8217;s communication opportunities</a>. In the early nineteenth century, the consensus of penal experts was that incarceration should seek to <a class="otx-link" title="Transnational Consensus Supported Suppressing Prisoners&#8217; Communication" href="http://cwpc.github.io/transnational-consensus-supports-suppressing-prisoners-communication/?otxkey=post-960">cut off all communication between the prisoner and the outside world</a>. That view has slowly changed. An important 1974 U.S. Supreme Court opinion observed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether an O. Henry writing his short stories in a jail cell or a frightened young inmate writing his family, a prisoner needs a medium for self-expression. (<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=416&amp;invol=396"><em>Procunier v. Martinez</em></a>, 416 U.S. 396, 428, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1818 (1974), dissenting opinion of Justice Thurgood Marshall)</p></blockquote>
<p>Self-expression is vital for all human beings, including prisoners. Self-expression emerged as a major explanation for <a class="otx-link" title="From Second-Personal to Third-Personal Standpoints" href="http://cwpc.github.io/second-third-personal-standpoints/?otxkey=post-9640">literary authorship in early nineteenth-century British Romanticism</a>. Communication through a variety of communicative structures has personal and public value beyond self-expression. How prisoners’ communication is balanced between public works and personal communication with family and friends affects the political governance of punishment.</p>
<p>Communication across prison walls has been relatively heavily weighted toward public works and away from personal communication with family and friends. Prisoners have been relatively well-integrated across prison walls in the circulation of public works. Prisoners <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoners Read More Library Books Than Do Non-Prisoners" href="http://cwpc.github.io/prisoners-read-library-books/?otxkey=post-9076">read many more books</a> than persons living in the outside world do. Prisoners <a class="otx-link" title="Inmates Spend Relatively More Time Reading Than Do Non-Inmates" href="http://cwpc.github.io/inmates-time-reading/?otxkey=post-9136">watch as much television</a> as free persons do. Prisoners’ opportunities to communicate across prison walls with family and friends, in contrast, are tightly constrained. Personal communication with family and friends across prison walls is typically limited to a small number of personal visits, telephone calls, and letters. Prisoners&#8217; communication with family and friends is greatly reduced relative to now-normal constant, real-time electronic connectivity with friends and family through mobile smart phones.</p>
<p>Prisoners’ communicative position lessens <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoners Out of Sight, Out of Mind for Public" href="http://cwpc.github.io/prisoners-out-of-sight-out-of-mind/?otxkey=post-5247">accountability for prisoners’ sufferings</a>. Public works favor communication that <a class="otx-link" title="From Second-Personal to Third-Personal Standpoints" href="http://cwpc.github.io/second-third-personal-standpoints/?otxkey=post-9640">encapsulates address third-personally</a>, that <a class="otx-link" title="From Plotting Action to Revealing Character" href="http://cwpc.github.io/plotting-action-revealing-character/?otxkey=post-9939">emphasizes character</a>, and that is <a class="otx-link" title="Emotional Art: Changing Feelings from Imaginative Works" href="http://cwpc.github.io/emotional-art-changing-feelings/?otxkey=post-10100">emotionally labile</a>. These formal characteristics tend to make communication with prisoners an experience of temporary empathy, rather than a personal cry evoking accountability. The heavy weight of public works in communication with prisoners biases citizens away from politically effective understanding of prisoners’ sufferings.</p>

		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-231.jpg"></br><p>Prisoners remain members of the polity punishing them. One aspect of that membership is continuing participation in symbolic publics through access to public works: books, recorded music, radio, and television. However, a well-functioning polity is not created and sustained merely with public works. The communicative structure of public works <a class="otx-link" title="Democratic Failure: a Case Study of Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/democratic-failure-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-8022">has communicative weaknesses</a>. Those communicative weaknesses can undermine public accountability for imprisonment.</p>
<p>Public works encapsulate relations of address to form a group of third-person equals. A person becomes a member of a work’s public simply by gaining access to the work and directing attention to it.<a class="otx-link" title="Warner-2002 Publics and counterpublics" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/warner-2002-publics-and-counterpublics/?otxkey=Warner-2002&#038;otxrp=Ch.+2">^</a> Discussing his experience of reading in prison, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X">Malcolm X</a> declared, “Months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I had never been so truly free in my life.”<a class="otx-link" title="X-1965 The autobiography of Malcolm X. With the assistance" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/x-1965-the-autobiography-of-malcolm-x-with-the-assistance/?otxkey=X-1965&#038;otxrp=p.+176">^</a> At the same time, a public work can invite anyone to dwell imaginatively in prison. Actual personal characteristics and physical circumstances are irrelevant:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the most misfitting child<br />
Who&#8217;s chanced upon the library&#8217;s worth,<br />
Sits with the genius of the Earth<br />
And turns the key to the whole world.<a class="otx-link" title="Hughes-1997 Hear It Again" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/hughes-1997-hear-it-again/?otxkey=Hughes-1997&#038;otxrp=excerpt+from+poem%3A+Hear+It+Again">^</a></p>
<p><a class="otx-link" title="Milton&#8217;s Satan Echoes Lovelace in Prison" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/milton-satan-lovelace/?otxkey=notes-8928">Stone walls do not a prison make</a>,<br />
Nor iron bars a cage;<br />
Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
That for an hermitage;<br />
If I have freedom in my love,<br />
And in my soul am free,<br />
Angels alone that soar above,<br />
Enjoy such liberty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The imaginary equality of persons in symbolic publics makes prisoners’ public position like anyone else’s. No particular person in such a public has a particular claim on any other. Among a symbolic public, second-person address has no existential significance.</p>

Thackeray, Department of Library Extension, Brooklyn Public Library. &#8220;What Do Prisoners Read?&#8221; The Library Journal, Nov. 1, 1921, p. 900, earlier printed in the New York Times Magazine.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Public works build empathy rather than agency. Public works tend not to encourage readers to evaluate their own choices and make their own moves.<a class="otx-link" title="Wright-2007 Keynote Address at South by Southwest Interactive," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/wright-2007-keynote-address-at-south-by-southwest-interactive/?otxkey=Wright-2007&#038;otxrp=on+agency-building+vs.+empathy-building">^</a> One ex-prisoner explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that I’m out of prison I think about the other guys I met in Collins Bay {prison} who sunk themselves in remote crevices of time dwelling on Glenn Miller’s music. Or the ones who bought guitars and practiced ten hours a day, but never learned more than four or five cords. And the guys who build their dreams of a happy, prison-free future on a girl they’ve modelled after someone they knew in grade three. Or the funny ones who only live for the moment when they can get out and they can buy a ’49 Ford, just like the one they had back in ’58. All chromed. If only they can get that car, then everything will be all right.<a class="otx-link" title="Bailey-1970 The Culture of Prisons: Nostalgia as a way of life" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/bailey-1970-the-culture-of-prisons-nostalgia-as-a-way-of-life/?otxkey=Bailey-1970&#038;otxrp=p.+58">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Public works have well-bounded narratives that seek to absorb the public in their plots’ characters. Stories of vicious, incorrigible criminals’ horrible acts and of heroic prisoner-revolutionaries struggling against the capitalist-imperialist state’s brutal prison regime are <a class="otx-link" title="Prisoners Struggle Against Demands of Public Narratives" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/prisoners-public-narratives/?otxkey=notes-8931">popularly plotted public works</a>. Even works that that do not plot characters often acquire in public circulation a plot that expresses character. For example, readers commonly perceive “who” and “to whom” in reading tribal academic texts. Character is more important than plot in public works.</p>
<p>Public works create labile emotions that don&#8217;t motivate action. Modern popular reading (novels) typically includes subplots, changes in location, and developments over many days. Characters’ circumstances often change greatly in location, story-time, and emotional state in brief periods of reading-time. Since texts are fixed and public circulation of texts is temporally organized (“What’s the latest news?”; “What are they reading or watching now?”), a symbolic public’s compassion typically shifts relatively quickly from person to person over time.<a class="otx-link" title="Warner-2002 Publics and counterpublics" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/warner-2002-publics-and-counterpublics/?otxkey=Warner-2002&#038;otxrp=pp.+94-99">^</a> Compassion experienced from public works differs from compassion experienced in a personal encounter. Putting a book down doesn&#8217;t imply lack of accountability or ill will. That differs from letting a person down or putting a person down. Scientific research indicates that persons over-estimate the suffering of disabled persons.<a class="otx-link" title="Riis-2005 Ignorance of Hedonic Adaptation to Hemodialysis: A" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/riis-2005-ignorance-of-hedonic-adaptation-to-hemodialysis-a/?otxkey=Riis-2005">^</a> Even extraordinarily heightened textual representations of prisoners’ suffering do not necessarily induce action to help prisoners.</p>
<p>Public works do not imply the responsibilities of ordinary communication with intimates. Public works support voluntary relations among strangers. Relations among intimates have significantly different communicative qualities than relations among persons in a symbolic public. For example, a successful author, imprisoned, wrote poetry. One of his poems presents the difficulty of personal communication with his family:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fearing<br />
they would be hurt,<br />
or used to blackmail<br />
me, I<br />
never once asked to<br />
see,<br />
speak,<br />
visit,<br />
telephone</p>
<p>my family<br />
cannot know</p>
<p>This lie,<br />
worn<br />
to the softness of a favourite shirt<br />
disintegrates when I touch it.<a class="otx-link" title="Abani-2000 Kalakuta Republic" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/abani-2000-kalakuta-republic/?otxkey=Abani-2000&#038;otxrp=p.+25%3B+see+also+pp.+22-4%2C+Portal">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Another prisoner explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s unquestionably a mixed blessing, this business of visits. Visits probably cost an inmate three times as much as they’re worth; a single hour visit is often enough to throw a man into a frenzy for a week; a regular weekly visit can keep an inmate unsettled through his entire term. Nevertheless, I’ve rarely met an inmate who would turn down a visit if it was offered, and many use up their entire mail ration (two letters a week) to arrange for them as often as they can. … The trouble with visits is that they won’t let you forget.<a class="otx-link" title="Schroeder-1976 Shaking it rough: a prison memoir" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/schroeder-1976-shaking-it-rough-a-prison-memoir/?otxkey=Schroeder-1976&#038;otxrp=p.+135">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>For prisoners, emotional balance in visits with family and friends isn&#8217;t clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had many visits from them, and all of them were bittersweet affairs. … I never tried to figure out whether the pleasure of those visits outbalanced the pain.<a class="otx-link" title="Runyon-1953 In for life, a convict’s story" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/runyon-1953-in-for-life-a-convicts-story/?otxkey=Runyon-1953&#038;otxrp=p.+113">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Communication with intimates recognizes difficulties of communication and demands action in response to them:</p>
<blockquote><p>in an atmosphere tense with the sense that two weeks or two months of the past have to be lived up to date in two hours, the opportunities for misunderstanding are myriad. I won’t even try to remember how many of my nights after visits have been spent penning long, apologetic letters to my girlfriend trying to explain my clumsy behavior to her, her perplexing behavior to me and our duplex confusions together.<a class="otx-link" title="Schroeder-1976 Shaking it rough: a prison memoir" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/schroeder-1976-shaking-it-rough-a-prison-memoir/?otxkey=Schroeder-1976&#038;otxrp=p.+136">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike personal communication, public works suspend time and serve memory authoritatively among strangers.<a class="otx-link" title="Warner-2002 Publics and counterpublics" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/warner-2002-publics-and-counterpublics/?otxkey=Warner-2002&#038;otxrp=Ch.+2">^</a> In a two-hour movie presentation of a famous inmate’s life, communication difficulties typically play no part in the audience&#8217;s relation. For public works, the imperatives of wide public circulation constrain emotional complexity and dynamism in communication. Public works don&#8217;t engage persons with prisoners in the way that personal communication does.</p>
