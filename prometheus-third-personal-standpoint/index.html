		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-243.jpg"></br><p><em>The Cenci</em>, <em>Prometheus Unbound, </em>and <em>Frankenstein</em> indicate effects of a third-personal standpoint on represented suffering. These three works were <a class="otx-link" title="Timeline of Authoring &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prometheus Unbound&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Cenci&lt;/em&gt;" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/frankenstein-prometheus-unbound-cenci/?otxkey=notes-9729">written in about three years from late 1816 to late 1819</a>. They transfigure ideas from the classical Greek tragedy <em>Prometheus Bound</em> across a wide range of early nineteenth-century literary forms. <em>The Cenci</em>, subtitled a tragedy and written for popular stage performance, describes its source as historical events in sixteenth-century Italy. <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is a closet drama of poetic images and ideas intended as a revision of myth for elite literary readers. <em>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</em> is a novel formally similar to popular epistolary and gothic fiction from the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Suffering in punishment in these works implies less accountability than does <a class="otx-link" title="Second-Personal Standpoint in &lt;em&gt;Prometheus Bound&lt;/em&gt;" href="http://cwpc.github.io/prometheus-second-personal/?otxkey=post-9658">suffering in punishment in the <em>Prometheus Bound</em></a>. Even across a wide range of literary forms, a <a class="otx-link" title="From Second-Personal to Third-Personal Standpoints" href="http://cwpc.github.io/second-third-personal-standpoints/?otxkey=post-9640">third-personal standpoint</a> on suffering makes turning away from suffering less troubling.</p>
<p>In 1811, in his book <em>The return to nature, or, A defence of the vegetable regimen</em>, John Frank Newton described the ancient Greek account of Prometheus as an allegory. After presenting an illustrious, early seventeenth-century English philosopher’s interpretation of that allegory, Newton argued for his own, rather different interpretation.<a class="otx-link" title="Morton-2000 Radical food : the culture and politics of eating" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/morton-2000-radical-food-the-culture-and-politics-of-eating/?otxkey=Morton-2000&#038;otxrp=p.+500%3B+The+English+philosopher+is+Francis+Bacon.+For+Bacon%27s+interpretation+of+Prometheus%2C+see+%3Cem%3EDe+Sapientia+Veterum%3C%2Fem%3E+%7BWisdom+of+the+Ancients%7D+%281609%29%2C+Ch.+26.">^</a> Newton explained that Prometheus’s gift of fire brought disease and woe to humans because fire promoted cooking and eating meat.</p>
<p>Newton’s interpretation of Prometheus won over the young Percy Bysshe Shelley. Shelley presented Newton’s argument, with additional elaboration, in his polemical pamphlet, <em>A Vindication of Natural Diet </em>(1813)<em>.</em> <em> </em>Shelley also incorporated Newton&#8217;s argument into notes to his long poem <em>Queen Mab </em>(1813).<a class="otx-link" title="Shelley-2003 The major works" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/shelley-2003-the-major-works/?otxkey=Shelley-2003&#038;otxrp=p.+84+%28Queen+Mab%2C+Note+to+8.211-2%29">^</a> Shelley’s <em>A Vindication of Natural Diet</em> featured on its front cover an untranslated quotation in Greek from Hesiod’s <em>Works and Days</em>. In <a class="otx-link" title="Shelley: Prometheus&#8217;s Theft of Fire Brings Plague of Meat-Eating" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/prometheus-meat-eating/?otxkey=notes-9691">that quotation</a>, Zeus declares that Prometheus’s theft of fire will bring a great plague to men. Newton’s and Shelley’s texts on vegetarianism included many classical references and quotations in Latin and Greek. Both Newton and Shelley used their allegorical interpretation of Prometheus in marshaling ancient authorities to support vegetarianism to elite readers.</p>
<p>A rage for Aeschylus, and particularly <em>Prometheus Bound</em>, gripped early nineteenth-century Britain. In 1773, <em>Prometheus Bound</em> became the <a class="otx-link" title="Aeschylus Became Fashionable in Early 19th-Century England" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/aeschylus-fashionable-england/?otxkey=notes-9697">first play attributed to Aeschylus to be printed in English translation</a>.<a class="otx-link" title="Morrell-1773 Prometheus in Chains, Translated from the Greek of" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/morrell-1773-prometheus-in-chains-translated-from-the-greek-of/?otxkey=Morrell-1773">^</a> Four years later, Potter&#8217;s English prose translation of all of Aeschylus’s extant plays was printed.<a class="otx-link" title="Curran-1986 Shelleyan Drama" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/curran-1986-shelleyan-drama/?otxkey=Curran-1986&#038;otxrp=p.+263+%28describing+Richard+Potter%27s+prose+translation%29">^</a> Interest in Aeschylus rose through the beginning of the nineteenth century. Potter&#8217;s translation was reprinted in 1808.<a class="otx-link" title="Potter-1808 Tragedies of Aeschylus" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/potter-1808-tragedies-of-aeschylus/?otxkey=Potter-1808">^</a> In 1809 and 1810, three editions of Aeschylus’s Greek texts and two editions of English translations came out. An intense scholarly battle over recensions of Aeschylus’s Greek texts droned on. That controversy spanned the specialized quarterly <em>Classical Journal</em>, founded in London in 1810, the literary quarterly <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, and the general-interest monthly <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em>.<a class="otx-link" title="Curran-1986 Shelleyan Drama" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/curran-1986-shelleyan-drama/?otxkey=Curran-1986&#038;otxrp=pp.+264%2C+282%2C+n.+12-13.+The+Edinburgh+Review+was+founded+in+1802%2C+and+the+Gentlemans+Magazine%2C+in+1731.">^</a> Between 1795 and 1825, British printers produced seven editions of Aeschylus’s collected works and fourteen editions of individual plays attributed to Aeschylus.<a class="otx-link" title="Curran-1986 Shelleyan Drama" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/curran-1986-shelleyan-drama/?otxkey=Curran-1986&#038;otxrp=pp.+263-4">^</a></p>
<p>Ambitious writers in early-nineteenth-century England studied and thought at length about <em>Prometheus Bound</em>. Byron, writing to his publisher in 1817, declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the Prometheus of Aeschylus I was passionately fond as a boy (it was one of the Greek plays we read thrice a year at Harrow) ; — indeed that and the &#8216;Medea&#8217; were the only ones, except the &#8216;Seven before Thebes,&#8217; which ever much pleased me. … The Prometheus, if not exactly in my plan, has always been so much in my head, that I can easily conceive its influence over all or any thing that I have written <a class="otx-link" title="Marchand-1973 Byron’s letters and journals : the complete and" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/marchand-1973-byrons-letters-and-journals-the-complete-and/?otxkey=Marchand-1973&#038;otxrp=Byron+to+John+Murray%2C+Oct.+12%2C+1817">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to his short poem “Prometheus,” Byron referred to Prometheus in <em>Manfred</em> (1817) and <em>Don Juan, Canto the First</em> (1819). William Wordsworth invoked Prometheus in <em>The Excursion</em> (1814). John Keats did so in <em>Endymion</em> (1817). In 1825 before the Royal Society of Literature in London, Samuel Taylor Coleridge gave a lecture entitled <em>On the Prometheus of Aeschylus</em>.<a class="otx-link" title="Podlecki-2005 Prometheus bound" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/podlecki-2005-prometheus-bound/?otxkey=Podlecki-2005&#038;otxrp=pp.+1-63">^</a></p>
<p>Shelley, like those leading literary men of his time, studied and thought at length about <em>Prometheus Bound</em>. Thomas Medwin, one of Shelley’s close friends, described Shelley’s activities in Geneva in the summer of 1816:</p>
<blockquote><p>He reads incessantly. His great studies at this time were the Greek dramatists, especially Aeschylus’s Prometheus, whom he considered the type of Milton’s Satan. He translated this greatest of tragedies to Byron, a very indifferent Greek scholar, which produced his sublime ode on Prometheus<a class="otx-link" title="Medwin-1847 The life of Percy Bysshe Shelley" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/medwin-1847-the-life-of-percy-bysshe-shelley/?otxkey=Medwin-1847&#038;otxrp=pp.+160-1">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Shelley became devoted to reading ancient Greek and Roman works in the original languages.<a class="otx-link" title="Burriss-1926 The Classical Culture of Percey Bysshe Shelley" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/burriss-1926-the-classical-culture-of-percey-bysshe-shelley/?otxkey=Burriss-1926">^</a> In her journal’s list of books that Shelley read in 1816, Mary Shelley recorded <em>Prometheus Bound</em>.<a class="otx-link" title="Feldman-1987 The journals of Mary Shelley : 1814-1844" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/feldman-1987-the-journals-of-mary-shelley-1814-1844/?otxkey=Feldman-1987&#038;otxrp=p.+97">^</a> About a year later, Mary Shelley noted in her journal: “S {Shelley} traslates {translates} Promethes Desmotes {<em>Prometheus Bound}</em> and I write it.”<a class="otx-link" title="Feldman-1987 The journals of Mary Shelley : 1814-1844" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/feldman-1987-the-journals-of-mary-shelley-1814-1844/?otxkey=Feldman-1987&#038;otxrp=p.+177+%28entry+for+July+13%2C+1817%29">^</a> From July 22 to Aug. 5, 1817, Shelley read “plays of Aeschylus.”<a class="otx-link" title="Feldman-1987 The journals of Mary Shelley : 1814-1844" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/feldman-1987-the-journals-of-mary-shelley-1814-1844/?otxkey=Feldman-1987&#038;otxrp=pp.+102%2C+177-8">^</a> About the first third of an English translation of <em>Prometheus Bound,</em> written in Mary Shelley’s hand, has survived. Shelley apparently did that translation in the summer of 1817.<a class="otx-link" title="Weinberg-1997 Bodleian MS. Shelley adds. c. 5" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/weinberg-1997-bodleian-ms-shelley-adds-c-5/?otxkey=Weinberg-1997&#038;otxrp=pp.+22-6+%28id.+pp.+191-233+provides+a+transcription+of+the+manuscript%2C+Bodleian+MS.+Shelley+adds.+c.+5%2C+fols.+73-84%3B+the+translation+is+titled+Prometheus+Chained">^</a> Traveling through the Alps on March 26, 1818, Shelley marveled at the scenery. He wrote in Mary Shelley’s journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scene is like that described in the Prometheus of Aeschylus – Vast rifts &amp; caverns in the granite precipices – wintry mountains with ice &amp; snow above<a class="otx-link" title="Feldman-1987 The journals of Mary Shelley : 1814-1844" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/feldman-1987-the-journals-of-mary-shelley-1814-1844/?otxkey=Feldman-1987&#038;otxrp=p.+200+%28entry+for+Mar.+26%2C+1818%29">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Shelley&#8217;s close friend Thomas Medwin reported that, during the the winter of 1820-1821:</p>
<blockquote><p>he {Shelley} translated to me the Prometheus of Aeschylus, reading it as fluently as if written in French or Italian<a class="otx-link" title="Medwin-1847 The life of Percy Bysshe Shelley" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/medwin-1847-the-life-of-percy-bysshe-shelley/?otxkey=Medwin-1847&#038;otxrp=p.+242">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Shelley, drowned while sailing in 1822, reportedly died with a volume Aeschylus in his jacket pocket.<a class="otx-link" title="Trelawny-1878 Records of Shelley, Byron, and the author" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/trelawny-1878-records-of-shelley-byron-and-the-author/?otxkey=Trelawny-1878&#038;otxrp=pp.+189-90">^</a> Aeschylus, and especially <em>Prometheus Bound,</em> deeply shaped Shelley&#8217;s imagination.</p>
<p>In intimate communication, Shelley invoked <em>Prometheus Bound </em>from a third-personal standpoint. Shelley left his child and his pregnant wife Harriet in July, 1814, to pursue a relationship with Mary Godwin. In October, 1814, facing <a class="otx-link" title="Imprisonment for Debt in Early Modern England" href="http://cwpc.github.io/imprisonment-debt-early-modern-england/?otxkey=post-5494">imprisonment for debt</a> to a coach-maker, he desperately wrote to Harriet:</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot raise money soon enough – unless you can effect something I must go to Prison &amp; all our hopes of independence be finished. I see no resource. I must hide myself til the 6<sup>th</sup> &amp; then if you can raise no money, go to Prison to save my bail.</p>
<p>… If once in prison, confined in a damp cell, without a sixpence, without a friend (for I have mortgaged my income to Mr. Hookham) I must inevitably be starved to death.<a class="otx-link" title="Shelley-1964 Letters" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/shelley-1964-letters/?otxkey=Shelley-1964&#038;otxrp=p.+270+%28Shelley+letter+to+Harriet+Shelley%2C+cited+as+prob.+25+Oct.+1814%29">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas Hookham was a bookseller and a person whom Shelley addressed as a friend in 1812.<a class="otx-link" title="Shelley-1964 Letters" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/shelley-1964-letters/?otxkey=Shelley-1964&#038;otxrp=pp.+340-1+%28Shelley+letter+to+Thomas+Hookham+%28junior%2C+b.+1787%2C+d.+1867%29%2C+Dec.+17%2C+1812%29%3B+Shelley+subscribed+to+the+circulating+library+owned+by+Hookhams+father.+Shelley+offered+to+Hookham+the+opportunity+to+print+%3Cem%3ELetter+to+Lord+Ellenborough%3C%2Fem%3E+and+%3Cem%3EQueen+Mab%3C%2Fem%3E%2C+but+Hookham+declined.+Hookham%2C+perhaps+seeking+to+recover+money+Shelley+owed+to+him%2C+printed+with+Ollier+the+Shelleys+%3Cem%3EA+History+of+Six+Weeks+Tour%3C%2Fem%3E+%281817%29.+Id.+p.+319.">^</a> Soon after he wrote the above to Harriet, Shelley wrote to Mary Godwin:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you see Hookham, do not insult him openly. I have still hopes. We must not resign an inch of hope. I will make this remorseless villain loathe his own flesh – in good time. He shall be cut down in his season. His pride shall be trampled into atoms. I will wither up his selfish soul by peacemeal {sic}.<a class="otx-link" title="Shelley-1964 Letters" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/shelley-1964-letters/?otxkey=Shelley-1964&#038;otxrp=p.+271+%28Shelley+letter+to+Mary+Godwin%2C+cited+as+prob.+Oct.+25%2C+1814%29">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Passive-aggressiveness seems to have been an aspect of Shelley&#8217;s personality.<a class="otx-link" title="Jones-1994 Shelley&#039;s satire : violence, exhortation, and" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/jones-1994-shelleys-satire-violence-exhortation-and/?otxkey=Jones-1994&#038;otxrp=p.+31">^</a> Shelley appended to this letter a quotation in Greek from <em>Prometheus Bound.</em> In English translation, the Greek quotation was “hissing terror from his horrid jaws.” Shelley commonly quoted or referred to authors he was reading or had just read.<a class="otx-link" title="Notopoulos-1943 The Dating of Shelley&#039;s Prose" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/notopoulos-1943-the-dating-of-shelleys-prose/?otxkey=Notopoulos-1943&#038;otxrp=p.+478%7D">^</a> Shelley apparently was reading <em>Prometheus Bound</em> in Oct, 1814. Reading <em>Prometheus Bound</em> influenced Shelley&#8217;s personal communication in circumstances of acute personal stress.</p>
<p>Shelley’s Greek quotation from <em>Prometheus Bound</em> in his letter to his lover Mary Godwin concerns the monster Typhos. According to <em>Prometheus Bound, </em>Typhos violently challenged the ruling god Zeus. Zeus responded by hurling lightening at Typhos:</p>
<blockquote><p>… blasting his<br />
boasting tongue and scorching his<br />
heart, his strength sent packing.<br />
He lies there now,<br />
helpless, limp</p></blockquote>
<p>A few lines later in the same speech, Prometheus recounted what will happen at some indefinite future time:</p>
<blockquote><p>One day rivers of fire will<br />
leap from that peak, and flowing,<br />
devour Sicily’s fruitful plains.<br />
This will be Typhos,<br />
Typhos burnt to ashes by Zeus’ thunderbolt,<br />
but his rage will spew out<br />
mountains of glowing<br />
rock and fiery spray.<a class="otx-link" title="Mueller-2002 Aeschylus : the complete plays" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/mueller-2002-aeschylus-the-complete-plays/?otxkey=Mueller-2002&#038;otxrp=p.+325">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Typhos, like Prometheus, endured punishment from Zeus. Unlike Prometheus, Typhos struck back violently. Shelley seems to have imagined himself as Typhos in <em>Prometheus Bound</em>. A critic has discerned more generally in Shelley&#8217;s poetry “an essentially retributive aesthetic … a highly self-conscious embrace of penal retributivism.”<a class="otx-link" title="Canuel-2007 The shadow of death : literature, romanticism, and" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/canuel-2007-the-shadow-of-death-literature-romanticism-and/?otxkey=Canuel-2007&#038;otxrp=pp.+129-41">^</a></p>
<p>Within Shelley&#8217;s letter to his lover Mary Godwin, the quotation from <em>Prometheus Bound</em> is third-personal communication. Shelley quoted <em>Prometheus Bound</em> in ancient Greek. <a class="otx-link" title="Mary Godwin&#8217;s Greek Learning in Response to Shelley&#8217;s Letter" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/mary-godwin-greek-learning/?otxkey=notes-9699">Mary Godwin could not read Greek</a>. Shelley didn&#8217;t append the quotation to his letter to impress Mary with his classical knowledge. That would have been inappropriate for the letter’s circumstances and unnecessary in any case. The quotation is best understood to be Shelley connecting his letter to what he perceived to be a third-personal force in the imaginative universe: retributive justice.</p>
<p>Writing personally to Mary, Shelley didn&#8217;t consistently maintain a second-personal standpoint. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wander restlessly about I cannot read – or even write. But this will soon pass. I should not infect my own Mary with my dejection. She has sufficient cause for disturbance to need consolation from me. Well we shall meet today. I cannot write. But I love you with so unalterable a love that the contemplation of me will serve for a letter.<a class="otx-link" title="Shelley-1964 Letters" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/shelley-1964-letters/?otxkey=Shelley-1964&#038;otxrp=p.+271+%28Shelley+letter+to+Mary+Godwin%2C+prob.+25+Oct.+1814%29">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Shelley&#8217;s cosmic view of himself is &#8220;this will soon pass.&#8221; With respect to Mary, Shelley shifted to first-personal self-address (&#8220;I should not infect my own Mary with my dejection&#8221;). Mary&#8217;s “disturbance” was her pregnancy with their child. Shelley also shifted to Mary’s second-personal standpoint: “contemplation of me will serve for a letter {to you}.” Shelley&#8217;s letter to Mary was not consistently second-personal address to her.</p>
<p>A Promethean theme from a third-personal standpoint unite <em>The Cenci</em>, <em>Prometheus Unbound, </em>and <em>Frankenstein</em>. None of these works achieved immediate success in the intense <a class="otx-link" title="Crowds at Public Executions Depended on Attacting Attention" href="http://cwpc.github.io/crowds-executions-attention/?otxkey=post-9445">competition for attention</a> in early nineteenth-century England. Both <em>The Cenci</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em> were initially <a class="otx-link" title="Shelley&#8217;s Strategy for Publicly Distributing &lt;em&gt;The Cenci&lt;/em&gt;" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/shelley-cenci-publicity/?otxkey=notes-9859">offered publicly as anonymously authored works</a> deliberately <a class="otx-link" title="Prefaces to the 1818 and 1831 Editions of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/prefaces-editions-frankenstein/?otxkey=notes-9750">presented in ways to attract public attention</a>. <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, in contrast, Shelley seems to have written to circulate through only poetic means and forces. That intentional authorial distinction didn&#8217;t make a difference for Shelley&#8217;s Promethean communicative standpoint. The distinction between a second-personal standpoint and a third-personal standpoint is <a class="otx-link" title="From Second-Personal to Third-Personal Standpoints" href="http://cwpc.github.io/second-third-personal-standpoints/?otxkey=post-9640">fundamentally important for moral accountability</a>. <em>The Cenci</em>, <em>Prometheus Unbound, </em>and <em>Frankenstein</em> together indicate that a third-personal standpoint was a deep structural feature of literary imagination within the communicative circumstances of early-nineteenth-century England.</p>
