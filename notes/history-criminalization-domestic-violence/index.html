		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-194.jpg"></br><p>A mythic history of expansive domestic-violence criminalization has arisen along with <a class="otx-link" title="Influential Claim about Domestic Violence Against Women" href="http://cwpc.github.io/influential-claim-about-injuries-from-domestic-violence-against-women/?otxkey=post-6702">sensational, false claims about the extent of domestic violence against women</a>. For example, a peer-reviewed article on protective-order (restraining-order) legislation was published in the <em>Journal of Criminal Justice</em> in 2003. That article begin with the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, legislation failed to make assaulting one&#8217;s wife a crime.<a class="otx-link" title="Eigenberg-2003 Protective order legislation: Trends in state stat" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/eigenberg-2003-protective-order-legislation-trends-in-state-stat/?otxkey=Eigenberg-2003">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s literally true, but not obviously significant. Legislation has failed to make assaulting a person with a frying pan a crime. Serious physical assault has long been recognized as a crime in most jurisdictions. Legislation need not itemize every specific possible criminal act. How is not explicitly criminalizing assaulting one&#8217;s wife a legal failure? Should assaulting one&#8217;s husband be explicitly specified as a crime?</p>
<p>Given that <a class="otx-link" title="Men&#8217;s Ignored Suffering from Serious Domestic Violence Injuries" href="http://cwpc.github.io/men-ignored-domestic-violence-injuries/?otxkey=post-7017">domestic violence against men has been widely ignored</a> in public discussion of domestic violence, criminalizing assaulting one&#8217;s husband could be a socially important expressive act. On the other hand, the U.S. currently has an <a class="otx-link" title="Exceptional Increase in Imprisonment in U.S. Since 1980" href="http://cwpc.github.io/exceptional-increase-imprisonment-us/?otxkey=post-7590">extraordinarily high prevalence of incarceration</a> and broad opportunities for public communication. <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic Violence Policies Central to Mass Incarceration" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-policies-mass-incarceration/?otxkey=post-8173">Expansive criminalization of domestic violence</a> is best understood as a public communications policy. It should be explicitly and deeply questioned within the distinctive U.S. circumstances of mass incarceration and broad opportunities for communication.</p>
<p>Expansive criminalization of domestic violence has significant costs. Close personal relations are <a class="otx-link" title="Family Law Is Constitutional Law in Everyday Life" href="http://cwpc.github.io/family-law-is-constitutional-law-in-everyday-life/?otxkey=post-6669">particularly vulnerable to criminalization</a>. Addressing domestic violence currently accounts for a <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic Violence Large Share of Justice System Activity" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-large-part-of-justice-system/?otxkey=post-7512">large share of U.S. justice system action addressing interpersonal violence</a>. While most domestic violence incidents involve <a class="otx-link" title="Circumstances of Domestic Violence Calls to Police" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/domestic-violence-police-calls/?otxkey=statistics-7681">conduct not serious on operational scales of justice-system concern</a>, domestic violence interests have developed terms-of-art such as &#8220;batterer&#8221; and &#8220;escalating cycle of violence.&#8221; Those terms are commonly and misleadingly deployed to refer to all domestic violence incidents.<a class="otx-link" title="Cavanaugh-2005 The Utility of Male Domestic Violence Offender Typologies:" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/cavanaugh-2005-the-utility-of-male-domestic-violence-offender-typologies/?otxkey=Cavanaugh-2005">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Dutton-2005 The gender paradigm in domestic violence research" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/dutton-2005-the-gender-paradigm-in-domestic-violence-research/?otxkey=Dutton-2005">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Dunlap-1996 The Adult Abuse Act: Theory vs. Practice" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/dunlap-1996-the-adult-abuse-act-theory-vs-practice/?otxkey=Dunlap-1996">^</a> Such terms encourage <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic-Violence Emergency Law Has Broad Scope" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-emergency-law-has-broad-scope/?otxkey=post-7695">preemptive criminalization in anticipation of future acts</a>. Moreover, both academic literature and policy discussions pervasively support <a class="otx-link" title="Justifying Domestic-Violence Gender Stereotyping" href="http://cwpc.github.io/justifying-domestic-volence-gender-stereotyping/?otxkey=post-7440">anti-men gender stereotyping of domestic violence</a>. That&#8217;s particularly pernicious within circumstances of <a class="otx-link" title="Sex Ratio of Prisoners in U.S. Since 1880" href="http://cwpc.github.io/sex-ratio-prisoners-us-history/?otxkey=post-6056">highly disproportionate incarceration of men</a>. Expansive criminalization of domestic violence <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic-Violence Emergency Law Has Broad Scope" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-emergency-law-has-broad-scope/?otxkey=post-7695">undermines trust in close personal relations</a> and <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic Violence Policies Central to Mass Incarceration" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-policies-mass-incarceration/?otxkey=post-8173">supports mass incarceration</a>.</p>
<p>Recitations of mythic domestic-violence history have gained considerable public authority. In 1983, New Jersey added a domestic-violence section to its annual Uniform Crime Report. The introduction to the domestic-violence section began:</p>
<blockquote><p>The violence within the American domicile has been recognized for decades by elements of government and society with little done to correct the problem. Only in the recent past has government made more than a cursory examination of atrocities occurring within the home.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to this sensational history, &#8220;atrocities occurring within the home&#8221; have in the past attracted only cursory government examination. After repeating those two introductory sentences in the reports for the next two years, in 1986 the report adopted more objective language:</p>
<blockquote><p>The violence within the American domicile has been recognized for decades by elements of government and society with little done to correct the problem. Only recently has this phenomenon begun to receive the attention it deserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizing the merely formal function of &#8220;only recently&#8221; in mythic history, the above claim has been repeated verbatim in every subsequent New Jersey domestic-violence report across more than a quarter century. Recitations of mythic domestic-violence history have in other instances included a chronological anchor:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, police, prosecutors and judges in the U.S. have treated incidents of domestic violence more leniently than other offenses. Beginning in the 1970&#8217;s, reformers sought to have the criminal justice system respond to domestic violence offenders the same way it responded to offenders who committed comparable crimes against strangers.<a class="otx-link" title="Peterson-2003 Combating Domestic Violence in New York City: A Study" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/peterson-2003-combating-domestic-violence-in-new-york-city-a-study/?otxkey=Peterson-2003">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Whether police, prosecutors and judges in the past considered street or bar-room violence among men more seriously than men assaulting women in the home is far from clear. <a class="otx-link" title="Men Missing from National Injury Research Agenda" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/men-missing-injury-agenda/?otxkey=notes-6866">Violence against men</a> continues to be taken much less seriously than violence against women. Family law is a <a class="otx-link" title="Family Law Is Constitutional Law in Everyday Life" href="http://cwpc.github.io/family-law-is-constitutional-law-in-everyday-life/?otxkey=post-6669">complex, crucial, and marginalized area of constitutional law</a>. Most states, at least in the past, have considered intimate personal relations to have distinctive public significance. Notwithstanding <a class="otx-link" title="Castleton-2005 Ada Count Family Violence Court: Shaping the Means" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/castleton-2005-ada-count-family-violence-court-shaping-the-means/?otxkey=Castleton-2005">routine invocations of mythic domestic violence history</a>, that&#8217;s not an obvious policy mistake</p>
<p>Violence within families and homes has been an issue of public concern at least since Cain killed Abel. Among many others historically, Puritans in seventeenth-century New England denounced wife abuse and explicitly criminalized it. While the official declaration also referred to a wife&#8217;s assault upon her husband, it did not explicitly criminalize that assault.<a class="otx-link" title="Nadelhaft-2011 &#039;For Every Wrong There is a Remedy&#039;: Changing" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/nadelhaft-2011-for-every-wrong-there-is-a-remedy-changing/?otxkey=Nadelhaft-2011">^</a> Women who killed their husbands often have not been convicted of murder. False promises, a broken engagement, and a broken heart have in some cases been found under law to be sufficient justification for a woman to kill a man.<a class="otx-link" title="Ramsey-2006 Intimate Homicide: Gender and Crime Control, 1880-" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/ramsey-2006-intimate-homicide-gender-and-crime-control-1880/?otxkey=Ramsey-2006">^</a> Even in legal scholarship, exculpatory defenses for women are assumed to be true, e.g., women &#8220;stand trial for killing their batterers&#8221;.<a class="otx-link" title="Ramsey-2013 The Exit Myth: Family Law, GenderRoles, and Changing" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/ramsey-2013-the-exit-myth-family-law-genderroles-and-changing/?otxkey=Ramsey-2013">^</a> Similarly situated men stand trial for <a class="otx-link" title="Steinmetz on the Battered Husband Syndrome" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/steinmetz-on-the-battered-husband-syndrome/?otxkey=notes-7210">killing their wives</a>. In the historical context of the extraordinary, intentional violence against men in World War I and World War II, relatively low-level violence within families and homes may have seemed slightly less significant in mid-twentieth-century America. Nonetheless, by the early 1990s, <a class="otx-link" title="Criminal Suspicion: &lt;/br&gt;Domestic Violence Leading Cause of Injury to Women" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-leading-cause-injury-women/?otxkey=post-6682">sensational, grotesquely false claims about violence against women</a> were readily accepted across U.S. public discourses.</p>
<p>Intimate partner homicide has attracted far more attention than related categories of violence. Intimate partner homicides account for only about 10% of all homicides. The victim sex ratio for intimate partner homicides has fallen from about 0.82 men per women to 0.25 men per women from 1976 to 2008. Non-intimate partner homicides account for 90% of homicides. The victim sex ratio for this much larger set of homicides is <a class="otx-link" title="Intimate-Partner Homicide in Context of Homicide &amp; Suicide" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/intimate-partner-homicide/?otxkey=statistics-8066">about five men per women</a>. <a class="otx-link" title="Men Missing from National Injury Research Agenda" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/men-missing-injury-agenda/?otxkey=notes-6866">Injuries to men</a>, including killing men, have always been of relatively little social concern. Moreover, about <a class="otx-link" title="Intimate-Partner Homicide in Context of Homicide &amp; Suicide" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/intimate-partner-homicide/?otxkey=statistics-8066">six women commit suicide for every woman killed by an intimate partner</a>. Compared to intense public attention to intimate partner violence, relatively little public concern has arisen about women killing themselves. That pattern of public concern about intentional killings indicate <a class="otx-link" title="Deliberative Constitution for Criminalizing Men" href="http://cwpc.github.io/deliberative-constitution-for-criminalizing-men/?otxkey=post-6449">public support for criminalization of men</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, expansive criminalization of domestic violence has occurred in conjunction with highly substantive curtailments of civil liberties. The law governing domestic violence is essentially the <a class="otx-link" title="Characterizing Domestic-Violence Calls for State Action" href="http://cwpc.github.io/characterizing-domestic-violence-calls-for-state-action/?otxkey=post-7670">law of a state of emergency</a>, mundanely declared for more than a million individual households per year in the U.S. That emergency-law regime is uncritically administered with <a class="otx-link" title="Gender-Profiling Men for Arrest for Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/gender-profiling-men-arrests-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-7748">deeply entrenched anti-men gender bias</a>. Mythic history creates willful blindness to extraordinary policies:</p>
<blockquote><p>awareness of the courts&#8217; historic refusal to intervene on behalf of battered women led to the conscious elimination or avoidance of procedural protections that could provide reluctant judges with an excuse not to issue protective orders.<a class="otx-link" title="Jaros-2010 Unfettered Discretion: Criminal Orders of Protection" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/jaros-2010-unfettered-discretion-criminal-orders-of-protection/?otxkey=Jaros-2010">^</a></p>
<p>Mandatory arrest and ‘no-drop’ prosecution policies were developed to ensure intimate abuse received the same response from law enforcement as stranger violence.<a class="otx-link" title="Curtis-2006 Comment: The Supreme Court&#039;s Attack on Domestic" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/curtis-2006-comment-the-supreme-courts-attack-on-domestic/?otxkey=Curtis-2006">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Criminal law and procedure for <a class="otx-link" title="Arresting, Detaining, and Restraining for Domestic Violence Allegations" href="http://cwpc.github.io/arresting-detaining-domestic-violence-allegations/?otxkey=post-7720">arresting, detaining, and restraining persons upon allegations of domestic violence</a> are much broader than just the highly special practices of mandatory arrest and <a class="otx-link" title="Prosecuting Domestic Violence for Mass Incarceration of Men" href="http://cwpc.github.io/no-drop-domestic-violence-prosecution/?otxkey=post-7738">no-drop prosecution</a>. Criminal law and procedure addressing domestic-violence allegations emphasizes much less due process of law and much more coercive state power and control than do corresponding law and procedure for stranger violence. Under domestic violence law, a person can be effectively evicted from her home, prohibited from communicating with her spouse and children, deprived of property, and deprived of the right to bear arms. Those state actions can be invoked through nothing more than a person <a class="otx-link" title="Fundamental Liberties Fall to Simple Domestic Violence Petition" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-restraining-petition/?otxkey=post-7710">filing a form that receives only cursory state legal review</a>. The targeted person receives no due process under law before those deprivations of liberty are imposed on her. That&#8217;s completely different from law enforcement against stranger violence.</p>
<p>Current domestic violence law does not merely express in criminal law, as was not explicitly expressed in the past, that assaulting one&#8217;s wife is a crime. Current domestic violence law describes a separate, highly discriminatory regime of emergency state action against specific individuals. That regime is quite different from normal rule of law. Current domestic violence law and policies have little historical precedent in law-governed democracies. Domestic violence has always been a public concern. Recent expansive criminalization of domestic violence, and the <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic Violence Policies Central to Mass Incarceration" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-policies-mass-incarceration/?otxkey=post-8173">concomitant rise in mass incarceration</a>, has been driven by the rise of <a class="otx-link" title="Criminal Suspicion: &lt;/br&gt;Domestic Violence Leading Cause of Injury to Women" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-leading-cause-injury-women/?otxkey=post-6682">sensational belief in the extent of domestic violence against women</a>.</p>
