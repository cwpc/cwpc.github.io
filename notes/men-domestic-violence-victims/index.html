		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-240.jpg"></br><p><a class="otx-link" title="Men&#8217;s Ignored Suffering from Serious Domestic Violence Injuries" href="http://cwpc.github.io/men-ignored-domestic-violence-injuries/?otxkey=post-7017">Men who have suffered domestic violence</a> have largely been ignored. Poor-quality statistics have justified <a class="otx-link" title="Justifying Domestic-Violence Gender Stereotyping" href="http://cwpc.github.io/justifying-domestic-volence-gender-stereotyping/?otxkey=post-7440">gender-stereotyping domestic violence</a>, have minimized <a class="otx-link" title="Men Missing from National Injury Research Agenda" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/men-missing-injury-agenda/?otxkey=notes-6866">injuries to men</a>, and have supported <a class="otx-link" title="Gender-Profiling Men for Arrest for Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/gender-profiling-men-arrests-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-7748">gender-profiling men for arrest and prosecution for domestic violence</a>. Consider, for example, an article that the Assistant City Attorney for San Diego wrote in 2004. That article is entitled: “‘She hit me, too’ Identifying the Primary Aggressor: A Prosecutor’s Perspective.” The article begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>The historical statistics are well known: 95% of domestic violence is committed by men against women.<a class="otx-link" title="Strack-2004 &quot;She hit me, too&quot; Identifying the Primary" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/strack-2004-she-hit-me-too-identifying-the-primary/?otxkey=Strack-2004">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The article then goes on to express concern about the relatively large share of women being arrested for domestic violence. In San Diego, the share of women arrested for domestic violence was 15.7%.<a class="otx-link" title="Strack-2004 &quot;She hit me, too&quot; Identifying the Primary" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/strack-2004-she-hit-me-too-identifying-the-primary/?otxkey=Strack-2004">^</a> In California in 2004, women accounted for <a class="otx-link" title="Restraining Orders and Domestic Violence in California" href="http://cwpc.github.io/datasets/punishment-us-dv-ca/?otxkey=datasets-punishment-us-dv-ca&#038;otxrp=sheet%3A+arrests+annual">20% of arrests for domestic violence</a>. The prosecutorial official believed that such shares of women being arrested for domestic violence indicated a systemic problem. The prosecutor counseled more education in <a class="otx-link" title="Gender-Profiling Men for Arrest for Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/gender-profiling-men-arrests-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-7748">identifying the primary aggressor</a>.</p>
<p>Domestic violence literature now more commonly claims that 15% of domestic violence victims are men. That&#8217;s the figure for men&#8217;s share of victims of intimate-partner violence as reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).<a class="otx-link" title="Catalano-2012 Intimate Partner Violence, 1993-2010" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/catalano-2012-intimate-partner-violence-1993-2010/?otxkey=Catalano-2012">^</a> The U.S. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All-Injury Program (NEISS) provides <a class="otx-link" title="NEISS Better Than NCVS for Statistical Measure of Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/neiss-ncvs-statistics-domestic-violence/?otxkey=notes-7460">better-quality data on serious physical injuries from violence</a>. Based on NEISS, <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic-Violence Hospital Emergency Department Visits" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/domestic-violence-hospital-emergency-visits/?otxkey=statistics-6911">men&#8217;s share of serious physical injury from intimate-partner violence</a> in 2008 is an estimated 31%.</p>
<p>Intimate-partner violence does not include all victims of domestic violence. U.S. government reports typically define intimate-partner violence to include violence committed against current or former spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. Domestic violence typically encompasses intimate-partner violence and violence against other persons sharing a common household. Such persons include parents and their adult children, siblings, relatives, and unrelated roommates. Shared living quarters are more objectively relevant to victimization than is non-criminal sexual intimacy. Based on NEISS, <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic-Violence Hospital Emergency Department Visits" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/domestic-violence-hospital-emergency-visits/?otxkey=statistics-6911">men&#8217;s share of serious physical injury from domestic violence</a> in 2008 is an estimated 42%.</p>
<p><a class="otx-link" title="Bitter Scholarly Controversy about Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/bitter-scholarly-controversy-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-6995">Scholarly studies of domestic violence</a> haven&#8217;t served to clarify the objective truth about domestic violence. Credible scholarly studies show that men account for about half of victims of domestic violence. These studies encompass domestic violence of widely ranging severity, including domestic violence not resulting in serious physical injury. Domestic-violence law <a class="otx-link" title="Domestic-Violence Emergency Law Has Broad Scope" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-emergency-law-has-broad-scope/?otxkey=post-7695">criminalizes a wide range of harms not involving serious physical injury</a>. Most domestic-violence calls to police <a class="otx-link" title="Characterizing Domestic-Violence Calls for State Action" href="http://cwpc.github.io/characterizing-domestic-violence-calls-for-state-action/?otxkey=post-7670">do not involve serious physical injury</a>. In the context of broad criminalization of domestic violence and claims that <a class="otx-link" title="Mythic History of Expansive Criminalization of Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/history-criminalization-domestic-violence/?otxkey=notes-7688">domestic violence is an escalating cycle of violence</a>, even domestic violence that doesn&#8217;t involve serious injury should be of public concern for both men and women victims.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many scholarly studies address only women victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence activists have largely <a class="otx-link" title="Separate and Unequal Domestic Violence Victim Services" href="http://cwpc.github.io/separate-unequal-domestic-violence-victim-services/?otxkey=post-7444">ignored men victims of domestic violence</a>. Funding for scholarly research on domestic violence is primarily directed at study of violence against women. Following political power and funding, many scholars and intellectual leaders have <a class="otx-link" title="Public Triumph of Gender Stereotyping Domestic Volence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/public-triumph-of-gender-stereotyping-domestic-volence/?otxkey=post-7406">argued vigorously against serious concern for domestic violence against men</a>. Scholarly studies of domestic violence that consider men as victims have been <a class="otx-link" title="Bitter Scholarly Controversy about Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/bitter-scholarly-controversy-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-6995">submerged in bitter scholarly controversy</a>. Because of power, control, and money in funding domestic-violence research, domestic violence against men is commonly ignored.</p>
<p>The National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) illustrated the irrelevance of data for deterring gender-stereotyping of domestic violence. NVAWS took place in circumstances of <a class="otx-link" title="Criminal Suspicion: &lt;/br&gt;Domestic Violence Leading Cause of Injury to Women" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-leading-cause-injury-women/?otxkey=post-6682">widely exaggerated claims about domestic violence against women</a>, <a class="otx-link" title="Justifying Domestic-Violence Gender Stereotyping" href="http://cwpc.github.io/justifying-domestic-volence-gender-stereotyping/?otxkey=post-7440">pervasive gender-stereotyping of domestic violence</a>, and <a class="otx-link" title="Men&#8217;s Ignored Suffering from Serious Domestic Violence Injuries" href="http://cwpc.github.io/men-ignored-domestic-violence-injuries/?otxkey=post-7017">lack of recognition and conern for men victims</a>. NVAWS found that men accounted for 36% of victims of intimate-partner violence.<a class="otx-link" title="Tjaden-2000 Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/tjaden-2000-extent-nature-and-consequences-of-intimate-partner/?otxkey=Tjaden-2000">^</a> That&#8217;s NVAWS figure depending on a mere 12-month recall window, in contrast to <a class="otx-link" title="NVAWS Weaknesses in Recall Period and Survey Question Bounding" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/nvaws-weaknesses-in-recall-period-and-survey-question-bounding/?otxkey=statistics-6933">its figure depending on a truly incredible lifetime recall</a>. The NVAWS report declared that &#8220;women are significantly more likely than men to report being victims of intimate partner violence.&#8221; The NVAWS report further declared that its finding challenged scholarly work showing gender equality in intimate-partner victimization.<a class="otx-link" title="Tjaden-2000 Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/tjaden-2000-extent-nature-and-consequences-of-intimate-partner/?otxkey=Tjaden-2000">^</a> NVAWS has <a class="otx-link" title="National Violence Against Women Survey: Communicative Context" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/national-violence-against-women-survey/?otxkey=notes-6955">serious methodological problems and biases</a>. Most obviously, NVAWS ignored that its own finding of men being 36% of victims challenged the <a class="otx-link" title="Gender-Profiling Men for Arrest for Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/gender-profiling-men-arrests-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-7748">pervasive anti-men bias in domestic-violence law and policy</a>.</p>
<p>The 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) similarly did not highlight a large share of men among victims of intimate-partner physical violence. NISVS indicates that 4.7 million women and 5.4 million men suffered from physical violence from an intimate partner in the prior year. Men thus accounted for 53% of victims of intimate-partner physical violence. The NISVS 2010 Summary Report didn&#8217;t include that finding in its Executive Summary. NISVS also didn&#8217;t ask about threats with a knife. That omission plausibly decreased the number of men victims identified.<a class="otx-link" title="Hoff-2012 US National Survey: more men than women victims of" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/hoff-2012-us-national-survey-more-men-than-women-victims-of/?otxkey=Hoff-2012">^</a> NISVS shares many of the <a class="otx-link" title="National Violence Against Women Survey: Communicative Context" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/national-violence-against-women-survey/?otxkey=notes-6955">weaknesses of the NVAWS</a>. Rather than openly acknowledge the anti-men gender bigotry that pervades the literature on intimate partner violence and sexual violence, NISVS apparently worked to validate the <a class="otx-link" title="Men Missing from National Injury Research Agenda" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/men-missing-injury-agenda/?otxkey=notes-6866">dominant agenda for policy on violence and injury</a>.</p>
<p>Police reports describe police judgments concerning the subset of domestic violence incidents brought to police attention. Police judgments of who is a domestic-violence victim are much more practically significant that survey administrators&#8217; judgments of who is a victim. In the U.S. in the 2000s, <a class="otx-link" title="Gender Differences in Police Domestic Violence Statistics" href="http://cwpc.github.io/statistics/gender-police-domestic-violence/?otxkey=statistics-7815">about 25% of police-identified domestic-violence victims</a> were men. Given <a class="otx-link" title="Gender-Profiling Men for Arrest for Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/gender-profiling-men-arrests-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-7748">profiling of men for arrest for domestic violence</a>, men who are victims of domestic violence have good reason to fear being falsely arrested for domestic violence.<a class="otx-link" title="Cook-1997 Abused men : the hidden side of domestic violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/cook-1997-abused-men-the-hidden-side-of-domestic-violence/?otxkey=Cook-1997">^</a> In the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) from 2001 to 2005, the share of intimate-partner victimizations reported to the police was 70% for black females, compared to 47% for black males.<a class="otx-link" title="Catalano-2007 Intimate Partner Violence in the United States" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/catalano-2007-intimate-partner-violence-in-the-united-states/?otxkey=Catalano-2007">^</a> Black men are rightly afraid of calling the police. A fair review of all the evidence doesn&#8217;t indicate that police are mistakenly identifying men as victims of domestic violence. If the criminal justice system addressed domestic violence without gender bias and without gender stereotyping, one would reasonable expect the share of men victims in police reports to be higher than 25%.</p>
<p>Many persons involved in addressing domestic violence seem willfully blind to men victims of domestic violence. Consider, for example, a 2012 Tennessee Bureau of Investigations&#8217; report on domestic violence. It declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Domestic violence may often be perceive as violence against women. There are numerous agencies nationally and locally that advocate specifically for battered and abused women. The current analyses of domestic offenses in the state of Tennessee supports this notion that domestic violence is most often perpetrated on female victims. Data collected from TIBRS {Tennessee Incident-Based Reporting System) revealed that women were consistently the primary victims of domestic violence offenses each year from 2009 through 2011 &#8230;. Male victims accounted for 27.8 percent of all domestic violence victims. As such, females in Tennessee are three times more likely than male to become victims of domestic abuse.<a class="otx-link" title="TNDVR-2012 Tennessee Domestic Violence Report" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/tndvr-2012-tennessee-domestic-violence-report/?otxkey=TNDVR-2012">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This report tendentiously supports <a class="otx-link" title="Justifying Domestic-Violence Gender Stereotyping" href="http://cwpc.github.io/justifying-domestic-volence-gender-stereotyping/?otxkey=post-7440">pervasive gender stereotyping</a> while recognizing that <a class="otx-link" title="Separate and Unequal Domestic Violence Victim Services" href="http://cwpc.github.io/separate-unequal-domestic-violence-victim-services/?otxkey=post-7444">services for domestic violence victims almost exclusively serve women</a> and that men account for 27.8% of police-identified victims of domestic violence. That&#8217;s not merely the approach of an obscure Tennessee criminal-justice bureaucrat. The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges&#8217; influential <em>Burgundy Book</em> (<em>A Guide for the Effective Issuance &amp; Enforcement of Protection Orders</em>) noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although both women and men may be victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, women are the victims of the vast majority of these crimes. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than 85 percent of violent victimizations by intimate partners between 1993 and 1998 were perpetrated against women. &#8230; Data on male victimization do not document comparable victimizations and injury levels; do not account for women who act in self-defense; and do not measure financial control, intimidation, and isolation used by perpetrators of domestic violence against women. For these reasons, this publication refers to victims as women and perpetrators as men. However, all victims who <a class="otx-link" title="Fundamental Liberties Fall to Simple Domestic Violence Petition" href="http://cwpc.github.io/domestic-violence-restraining-petition/?otxkey=post-7710">seek the issuance or enforcement of protection orders</a> should be given available assistance and relief, regardless of gender.<a class="otx-link" title="Burgandy-2005 A Guide for Effective Issuance and Enforcement of" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/burgandy-2005-a-guide-for-effective-issuance-and-enforcement-of/?otxkey=Burgandy-2005">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>That appalling rationalization of gender stereotyping, which ignores much highly relevant factual data, concludes with a merely formal disavowal of Jim Crow reality. The reason that blacks were deprived of equal justice under law wasn&#8217;t just their minority status. That problem was bigotry much like the <a class="otx-link" title="Practical Implications of Current Domestic Violence Research" href="http://cwpc.github.io/practical-implications-domestic-violence-research/?otxkey=post-8243">gender bigotry now pervasive in addressing domestic violence</a>.</p>
