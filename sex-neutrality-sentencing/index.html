		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-160.jpg"></br><p>Criminal justice is a core function of the state. Deprivation of personal liberty through incarceration is a highly significant state action. The U.S. has <a class="otx-link" title="Exceptional Increase in Imprisonment in U.S. Since 1980" href="http://cwpc.github.io/exceptional-increase-imprisonment-us/?otxkey=post-7590">extraordinarily high prevalence of incarceration</a>. The sex ratio of incarcerated persons is <a class="otx-link" title="Sex Ratio of Prisoners in U.S. Since 1880" href="http://cwpc.github.io/sex-ratio-prisoners-us-history/?otxkey=post-6056">strongly skewed toward men</a>. Highly sex-disparate incarceration has attracted little public concern. Anti-men gender bias in criminal justice is not merely a justice system problem. It&#8217;s also a <a class="otx-link" title="Democratic Failure: a Case Study of Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/democratic-failure-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-8022">more general problem of public communication</a>.</p>
<p>Criminal justice sentencing is not sex-neutral in practice. A high-quality empirical study of U.S. federal criminal cases concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables, men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do. Women are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.<a class="otx-link" title="Starr-2012 Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/starr-2012-estimating-gender-disparities-in-federal-criminal/?otxkey=Starr-2012&#038;otxrp=p.+17">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Other studies have found similar results.<a class="otx-link" title="Doerner-2014 Gender and Sentencing in the Federal Courts: Are Women" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/doerner-2014-gender-and-sentencing-in-the-federal-courts-are-women/?otxkey=Doerner-2014">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Doerner-2010 The Independent and Joint Effects of Race/Ethnicity," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/doerner-2010-the-independent-and-joint-effects-of-raceethnicity/?otxkey=Doerner-2010">^</a> Sex bias in criminal justice system action is simply apparent in comparing sex ratios of commitments to prisons and jails to sex ratios of persons held in prisons and jails. Because the criminal justice system tends to hold men for longer, the ratio of men to women in prison or jails is <a class="otx-link" title="Commitments by Sex to U.S. Prisons and Jails, about 2000-2010" href="http://cwpc.github.io/datasets/prisoners-us-commitments-sex/?otxkey=datasets-prisoners-us-commitments-sex">about 50% higher</a> than the ratio of men to women committed to prisons or jails. Publications of the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics obscure this sex disparity.</p>
<p>Under a 1984 sentencing reform act, the U.S. Sentencing Commission was formed and directed to “assure that {sentencing} guidelines and policy statements are entirely neutral as to the race, sex, national origin, creed, and socio-economic status of offenders.”<a class="otx-link" title="SRA-1984 U.S. Sentencing Reform Act of 1984" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/sra-1984-u-s-sentencing-reform-act-of-1984/?otxkey=SRA-1984">^</a> Leading authorities associated with the Commission recognized sex disparities in sentencing, e.g. &#8220;female bank robbers are likely to serve six months less than their similarly situated male counterparts.&#8221;<a class="otx-link" title="Breyer-1988 The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/breyer-1988-the-federal-sentencing-guidelines-and-the-key-compromises/?otxkey=Breyer-1988&#038;otxrp=p.+5">^</a> Lack of sex neutrality in administering justice is a serious injustice.</p>
<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission&#8217;s directive that sentencing guidelines be “entirely neutral” with respect to sex did little to address disparate treatment in sentencing. In its 2004 report, <em>Fifteen Years of Guideline Sentencing</em>, the Sentencing Commission noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike race and ethnic discrimination, the evidence is more consistent that similar offenders are sometimes treated differently based on their gender. Gender effects are found in both drug and non-drug offenses and greatly exceed the race and ethnic effects discussed above. The typical male drug offender has twice the odds of going to prison as a similar female offender. Sentence lengths for men are typically 25 to 30 percent longer for all types of cases. Additional analyses show that the effects are present every year.<a class="otx-link" title="Sentencing-2004 Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing: An Assessment" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/sentencing-2004-fifteen-years-of-guidelines-sentencing-an-assessment/?otxkey=Sentencing-2004&#038;otxrp=p.+xv">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Schanzenbach-2005 Racial and Sex Disparities in Prison Sentences: The" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/schanzenbach-2005-racial-and-sex-disparities-in-prison-sentences-the/?otxkey=Schanzenbach-2005">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The report found that the sex disparity in sentencing was larger in 2001 than in 1984.<a class="otx-link" title="Sentencing-2004 Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing: An Assessment" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/sentencing-2004-fifteen-years-of-guidelines-sentencing-an-assessment/?otxkey=Sentencing-2004&#038;otxrp=p.+128%2C+Figure+4.9">^</a> Covering this high-profile sentencing report, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> issued a news article entitled “Commission Finds Racial Disparity in Jail Sentences.” The article did not mention gender disparities.<a class="otx-link" title="WSJ-2004s Commission Finds Racial Disparity in Jail Sentence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/wsj-2004s-commission-finds-racial-disparity-in-jail-sentence/?otxkey=WSJ-2004s">^</a> <em>The New York Times</em> titled its news article, “Sentencing Guideline Study Finds Continuing Disparities.” That article reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>The panel {conducted by the U.S. Sentencing Commission} examined how well the guidelines had brought uniformity to punishments, and found that while sentencing had become “more certain and predictable,” disparities still existed among races and regions of the country, with blacks generally receiving harsher punishment than whites.<a class="otx-link" title="NYT-2004s Sentencing Guideline Study Finds Continuing Dispar" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/nyt-2004s-sentencing-guideline-study-finds-continuing-dispar/?otxkey=NYT-2004s">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A syndicated version of the article was entitled, &#8220;Study examines sentencing rules; Racial disparities persist, despite guidelines.&#8221;<a class="otx-link" title="CG-2004s Study examines sentencing rules; Racial disparities" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/cg-2004s-study-examines-sentencing-rules-racial-disparities/?otxkey=CG-2004s">^</a> Neither article mentioned gender disparities. The Sentencing Commission&#8217;s finding that men generally receive longer prison sentences than women apparently wasn&#8217;t newsworthy. Perhaps everyone knows that&#8217;s true and no one cares.</p>
<p>Men are invisible in legal deliberation about bias in the criminal justice system. In 2003, in an influential speech to the annual meeting of the American Bar Association (ABA), a high-ranking U.S. judicial official raised fundamental questions about the fairness of the criminal justice system. He noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We must confront another reality. Nationwide, more than 40% of the prison population consists of African-American inmates. About 10% of African-American men in their mid-to-late 20s are behind bars. In some cities more than 50% of young African-American men are under the supervision of the criminal justice system.<a class="otx-link" title="Kennedy-2003 Speech at the American Bar Association Annual Meeting," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/kennedy-2003-speech-at-the-american-bar-association-annual-meeting/?otxkey=Kennedy-2003&#038;otxrp=p.+2">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The ABA President promptly organized an ABA commission to examine the criminal justice system. The ABA Commission considered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why more than 60 percent of our 2.1 million prison population are people of color and more than 20 percent are Hispanic.<a class="otx-link" title="ABA-2003 ABA Leadership; President Dennis W. Archer; American" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/aba-2003-aba-leadership-president-dennis-w-archer-american/?otxkey=ABA-2003">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The ABA Commission did not consider why <a class="otx-link" title="Sex Ratio of Prisoners in U.S. Since 1880" href="http://cwpc.github.io/sex-ratio-prisoners-us-history/?otxkey=post-6056">about ten men were in prison per woman in prison</a>. It focused on <a class="otx-link" title="Black Men Are Men: Getting Real about Mass Incarceration" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/black-men-mass-incarceration/?otxkey=notes-8269">racial and ethnic bias, detached from any reference to men</a>. Thus, in accordance with the ABA Commission’s recommendations, the ABA resolved:</p>
<blockquote><p>That the American Bar Association urges states, territories and the federal government to strive to eliminate actual and perceived racial and ethnic bias in the criminal justice system. By enacting measures that would:</p>
<p>(1) Establish Criminal Justice Racial and Ethnic Task Forces ….</p>
<p>(2) Require law enforcement agencies to develop and implement policies and procedures to combat racial and ethnic <a class="otx-link" title="Gender-Profiling Men for Arrest for Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/gender-profiling-men-arrests-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-7748">profiling</a>…</p>
<p>(3) Require legislatures to conduct racial and ethnic disparity impact analyses to evaluate the potential disparate effects on racial and ethnic groups of existing statutes and proposed legislation; …propose legislative alternatives intended to eliminate predicted racial and ethnic disparity at each stage of the criminal justice process.<a class="otx-link" title="ABA-2004 Report to the House of Delegates, with recommendation" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/aba-2004-report-to-the-house-of-delegates-with-recommendation/?otxkey=ABA-2004">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Does the <a class="otx-link" title="Sex Ratio of Prisoners in U.S. Since 1880" href="http://cwpc.github.io/sex-ratio-prisoners-us-history/?otxkey=post-6056">highly disproportionate imprisonment of men</a> not matter? Are <a class="otx-link" title="Black Men Are Men: Getting Real about Mass Incarceration" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/black-men-mass-incarceration/?otxkey=notes-8269">men of color not men</a>?</p>
<p>Legal deliberation that addresses gender disparities in the criminal justice system often emphasizes differences that would be illegal or highly impolitic to emphasize in other policy discussions. A typical argument is that women’s care for their children is more important than men’s care for their children, and that the separation of women from their children hurts children more than the separation of men from their children. That would be a highly contentious assertion in considering daycare policy or employment discrimination.<a class="otx-link" title="SegalJ-2001 Family Ties and Federal Sentencing: A Critique of" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/segalj-2001-family-ties-and-federal-sentencing-a-critique-of/?otxkey=SegalJ-2001">^</a> Yet in deliberation about the criminal justice system, such arguments pass as accepted wisdom. A high-ranking judge in the English legal system recently noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many years ago, when training as a baby judge, I heard a very experienced judge comment that he was reluctant to send a woman to prison because she was usually the more useful member of the family.<a class="otx-link" title="Hale-2005 The Sinners and the Sinned Against: Women in the Criminal" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/hale-2005-the-sinners-and-the-sinned-against-women-in-the-criminal/?otxkey=Hale-2005">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>An employer who offered such an explanation for not sending female business executives on out-of-town trips could face a massive employment discrimination lawsuit. A leading legal historian addressed sex discrimination in sentencing with an anecdote:</p>
<blockquote><p>One judge in the Washington, D.C. area, who allowed he was, in fact, more lenient to women, could not explain why, except to say that “I love my mother very much.”<a class="otx-link" title="Friedman-1993 Crime and punishment in American history" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/friedman-1993-crime-and-punishment-in-american-history/?otxkey=Friedman-1993&#038;otxrp=p.+427">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Sex bias in sentencing can be considered <a class="otx-link" title="Sentencing Bias Against Men in Criminal Sentencing" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/sentencing-bias-against-men/?otxkey=notes-6573">using systematic empirical evidence</a>, but such evidence has attracted relatively little attention. Responses not otherwise tolerable apparently suffice for addressing the <a class="otx-link" title="Sex Ratio of Prisoners Across the World: Taking Gender Seriously" href="http://cwpc.github.io/sex-ratio-prisoners-across-world/?otxkey=post-6270">large sex disparity among persons in prison</a>.</p>
<p>Scholarly discussions of gender and criminal justice center on arguments that the criminal justice system should discriminate more so as to imprison fewer women. Women’s crime is different from men’s crime. Women offenders are victims, while men offenders are offenders. Women experience prison differently from men (women suffer more in prison, while men have been taught to take it like a man). Women prisoners have special needs, while men are regularly disposed <a class="otx-link" title="Historical European Sex Ratio in Punishment" href="http://cwpc.github.io/historical-european-sex-ratio-punishment/?otxkey=post-5361">in prison (or in death or in exile)</a>, or alternatively, <a class="otx-link" title="Military Service and Punishment As Alternatives for Disposing of Men" href="http://cwpc.github.io/military-service-punishment-disposing-men/?otxkey=post-5417">in military service</a>. All these assertions of difference are deeply rooted in gender stereotypes. Scholarly discussion of gender and criminal justice typically has not challenged these gender stereotypes, but rather has exploited them and re-enforceed them.<a class="otx-link" title="Rafter-1990 Partial justice : women, prisons, and social contr" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/rafter-1990-partial-justice-women-prisons-and-social-contr/?otxkey=Rafter-1990">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Fletcher-1993 Women Prisoners: A Forgotten Population" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/fletcher-1993-women-prisoners-a-forgotten-population/?otxkey=Fletcher-1993">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Hale-2005 The Sinners and the Sinned Against: Women in the Criminal" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/hale-2005-the-sinners-and-the-sinned-against-women-in-the-criminal/?otxkey=Hale-2005">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Raeder-2005 A Primer on Gender-Related Issues that Affect Female" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/raeder-2005-a-primer-on-gender-related-issues-that-affect-female/?otxkey=Raeder-2005">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Raeder-2006 Gender-Related Issues in a Post-Booker Federal Guidelines" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/raeder-2006-gender-related-issues-in-a-post-booker-federal-guidelines/?otxkey=Raeder-2006">^</a> <a class="otx-link" title="Catholic-2006 Women in Prison" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/catholic-2006-women-in-prison/?otxkey=Catholic-2006">^</a></p>
<p>Consider, for example, an article entitled, “Gender, crime, and the criminal justice system.” The Principal Research Officer in the U.K. Home Office Research and Planning Unit authored this article. It was published in 1995. About <a class="otx-link" title="Punishment Sex Ratio in England and Wales Since 1750" href="http://cwpc.github.io/punishment-sex-ratio-england-wales/?otxkey=post-5812">twenty-five men were then in prison in England and Wales</a> for every woman in prison there. The article set out to consider “whether there is any research or statistical evidence to support the view that women and girls are discriminated against in the criminal justice system.” Frustrating its framework of inquiry, the article concluded that “women appear to receive less severe sentences than men.” The article then suggested that existing research evidence indicates that the sentencing bias against men is a “legitimate reflection” of various (unaccounted for) circumstances, but also that the evidence “is equivocal.” As is conventional for authors interested in doing research, the author concluded, “more large-scale studies which control for a wide range of legal and social factors are required.”<a class="otx-link" title="Hedderman-1995 Gender, crime, and the criminal justice system" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/hedderman-1995-gender-crime-and-the-criminal-justice-system/?otxkey=Hedderman-1995&#038;otxrp=pp.+145%2C+156">^</a> The suicides of six female prisoners in 2003-2003 subsequently generated <a class="otx-link" title="Reports Support Greater British Imprisonment Sex Disparity" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/major-british-reports-supporting-increased-ratio-of-men-to-women-in-prison/?otxkey=notes-5828">many studies putting forward proposals that would raise the ratio of men in prison per woman in prison</a>.</p>
<p>Men leaders have designed prisons primarily for men, who make up the vast majority of prisoners. Men&#8217;s leadership in imprisoning men is unremarkable. A recent scholarly article noted, “As the unmarked gender category, men are &#8216;the norm,&#8217; the universal nongendered offender.” But rather than exploring possibilities for lowering the ratio of men in prison to women in prison, the article suggests</p>
<blockquote><p>we might imagine a form of gender neutrality that is female-normed, and we might fashion an equal treatment punishment scheme in which women, not men, are the standard.<a class="otx-link" title="Daly-1997 Gender, Race, and Sentencing" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/daly-1997-gender-race-and-sentencing/?otxkey=Daly-1997&#038;otxrp=pp.+202%2C+240-1">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>An &#8220;awkwardly simple&#8221; alternative is to reduce greatly the number of men in prison, so as to make men prisoners much less numerically prominent.<a class="otx-link" title="Black-1960 The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/black-1960-the-lawfulness-of-the-segregation-decisions/?otxkey=Black-1960&#038;otxrp=p.+421">^</a> That alternative seems unutterable within public deliberation about criminal justice.</p>
