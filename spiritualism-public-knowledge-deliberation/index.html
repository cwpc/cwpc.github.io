		<img class="aligncenter otx-face" alt="face of a prisoner" src="http://cwpc.github.io/wp-content/uploads/faces/prisoner-306.jpg"></br><p>In the mid-nineteenth century, <a class="otx-link" title="Edmonds&#8217; Empirical Validation of Spiritualism" href="http://cwpc.github.io/edmonds-empirical-validation-spiritualism/?otxkey=post-4496">John Edmonds&#8217; study of spiritual communication</a> generated intense criticism and personal hostility. Edmonds published his book <em>Spiritualism</em> even though he understood that doing so would cost him renomination to the New York Supreme Court. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was, week before last, …requested to withhold publication of my book, and was assured that if I would do so, my nomination and election would be secured. I declined to withhold it, and my defeat there {at the convention of one part of the Democratic Party} was not at all unexpected to me<a class="otx-link" title="Edmonds-1853c Letter from J.W. Edmonds to John Cochrane, Oct. 16, 1853," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/edmonds-1853c-letter-from-j-w-edmonds-to-john-cochrane-oct-16-1853/?otxkey=Edmonds-1853c">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The difficulty apparently was not Edmonds&#8217; spiritualist beliefs, but his publishing a book on them. Edmonds subsequently withdrew from seeking re-nomination to the New York Supreme Court.</p>
<p>After Edmonds&#8217; no longer sought judicial re-election, the<em> New York Times </em>harshly attacked his book and his intellect. The<em> New York Times</em> affirmed Edmonds’ judicial merit and concurred with his judicial decisions:</p>
<blockquote><p>We concur fully in the general concession that no Judge upon the bench has been more careful, conscientious and fearless in his office than Judge Edmonds, and his decisions have been moreover very able and correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>But such judicial merit, it argued, now should be recognized as an aberration that provides no basis for continuing confidence in Edmonds’ judicial ability:</p>
<blockquote><p>But this fact is, to our minds, even more remarkable than that he should have embraced his present notions, just as it is more wonderful that an insane man should act rationally on certain subjects, than it is that he should be insane. And such mental habits, opinions and lines of study as those to which Judge Edmonds is now surrendered, must render the operations of his intellect utterly unreliable, and destroy all confidence in the continued justice and correctness of his judicial actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article provided what many readers today probably would consider to be an accurate description of Edmonds’ book:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole collection is a jumble of commonplaces, puerilities, and absurdities; and the claim that they come from men to whom they are ascribed, is an attempt on popular credulity too audacious for the most comprehensive charity. …</p>
<p>the whole troop of spirits all talk just alike, &#8212; in English equally bad, in style equally affected and equally stuffed with attempts at poetic finery; &#8212; they all talk about the same things, in the same way: and not one of them utters a sentence which any man of ordinary brains and literary practice could not shape….</p></blockquote>
<p>The<em> New York Times</em> complained that <em>Spiritualism</em> was united by a &#8220;steady hostility to the essential elements of Christian faith&#8221; and compared its doctrines unfavorably to that of the &#8220;Mahomedans, the Mormons, and other imposters.&#8221; It concluded that, if read, the book will hurt the &#8220;weak-minded and credulous&#8221; while prompting &#8220;disciplined and healthy minds&#8221; to commiserate with Edmonds. It also concluded that the book was &#8220;too dull and uninteresting to attract many readers. &#8220;<a class="otx-link" title="EdmondsNYT-1853t Judge Edmonds on Spiritualism" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/edmondsnyt-1853t-judge-edmonds-on-spiritualism/?otxkey=EdmondsNYT-1853t">^</a> About two weeks later, it published a short, biting parody of Edmonds&#8217; book.<a class="otx-link" title="EdmondsNYT-1853p Judge Edmonds at Home" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/edmondsnyt-1853p-judge-edmonds-at-home/?otxkey=EdmondsNYT-1853p">^</a></p>
<p>Not only did <a class="otx-link" title="Number of Spiritualists in U.S. in the Mid-Nineteenth Century" href="http://cwpc.github.io/notes/number-spiritualists-us-nineteenth-century/?otxkey=notes-4529">spiritualism attract many adherents</a>, it also generated a large, scholarly styled polemical literature. Some books scientifically attacked spiritualism, e.g. <em>Modern spiritualism, scientifically demonstrated to be a mendacious humbug</em> (1856), and <em>Spiritualism answered by science</em> (1871). Publications attacked spiritualism as being counter to biblical religion, e.g. <em>Spiritualism an old epidemic under a new phases</em> (1857), <em>Spiritualism, a Satanic delusion, and a sign of the times</em> (1857), and <em>Spiritualism identical with ancient sorcery, New Testament demonology, and modern witchcraft; with the testimony of God and man against it</em> (1866). Some publications attacked spiritualism as being counter to both Scripture and known facts, e.g. <em>Spiritualism being examined and refuted: it being found contrary to Scripture, known facts and common sense</em> (1893), and <em>Spiritualism exposed giving Scriptural evidence and facts of experience, showing the evil nature and awful tendencies of spiritualism</em> (c. 1900). Businessmen attacked manipulative tricks of media, e.g. <em>Spiritualism and charlatanism; or, The tricks of the media. Embodying an exposé of the manifestations of modern spiritualism by a committee of business men of New-York </em>(1873). The<em> New York Times</em> suggested that Edmonds’ book was an indication of insanity. Later anti-spiritualist books argued that study of spiritualism produces insanity, e.g. <em>Spiritualism and insanity: an essay describing the disastrous consequences to the mental health which are apt to result from a pursuit of the study of spiritualism</em> (1909), <em>The philosophy of spiritualism and the pathology and treatment of mediomania</em> (1874), and <em>Spiritualism and insanity</em> (1877). Spiritualism was a popular topic in public deliberation. It was commonly dismissed as fallacious. But it was not successfully cast out of public discourse.</p>
<p>Spiritualism became a serious concern to important authorities. Controversy over spiritualism didn&#8217;t come merely from a monomaniacal fringe or from <a class="otx-link" title="John Edmonds&#8217; Spiritualist Testimony in the Mumler Case" href="http://cwpc.github.io/john-edmonds-spiritualist-testimony-mumler-case/?otxkey=post-4511">elites exploiting otherwise insignificant subjects for larger political purposes</a>. Prominent political and religious leaders were concerned about spiritualism’s consequences. For example, in 1854 in Trinity Church in Washington, D.C., a prominent clergyman preached about the risks that spiritual communication posed to public deliberation and to persons’ souls. The preacher was Reverend Clement Moore Butler. He served as U.S. Senate Chaplain from January, 1850, through December, 1853. He entitled his sermon “Modern Necromancy.” Attacking Judge Edmonds and other spiritualists, he pointed to the problem of conflicting testimony:</p>
<blockquote><p>On one occasion in the same room, a departed spirit through a Roman Catholic medium declared that there was a purgatory, and that it was essential to pass through its cleansing fires; while another Spirit through a Protestant medium insisted, by the most energetic raps, that there was no purgatory.</p></blockquote>
<p>Communication with spirits did not help to <a class="otx-link" title="Bitter Scholarly Controversy about Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/bitter-scholarly-controversy-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-6995">bring deliberation to agreement or mutual understanding</a>; rather, such communication created additional conflict and confusion. Such communication also belittled dead authorities:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is amazing that any person in his right mind should believe that these great {dead} men could be, at the same time, answering the summons of every ignorant and credulous person from California to New York and from Maine to Georgia, and that they should spend whole evenings in slowly rapping out a few sentences of unimportant intelligence, or of sentimental and mystical absurdity, of which they would have been ashamed on earth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting weighty motivation for his sermon, Reverend Butler strongly condemned communicating with spirits:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have brought this subject to your attention because much interest has been excited in regard to it in this community {Washington, D.C.}, and because I have been requested to express my views, and because I fear that some of you may be led, thoughtlessly, from curiosity, and with no idea of its impropriety, to tamper with this impious delusion of communicating with spirits, to the injury of your own souls and the souls of others.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an Episcopal priest, Reverend Butler was a member of a community that, at least formally, valued prayer and believed in the Holy Spirit, the resurrection of the dead, Heaven, Hell, and eternal life. The spiritual communication of Judge Edmonds and other spiritualists seems to have concerned Reverend Butler because he believed that it threatened important knowledge and good order in deliberation.<a class="otx-link" title="Butler-1854 Modern necromancy: a sermon preached in Trinity church," href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/butler-1854-modern-necromancy-a-sermon-preached-in-trinity-church/?otxkey=Butler-1854">^</a></p>
<p>Edmonds’ efforts to <a class="otx-link" title="Concern for Knowledge in Communication with the Dead" href="http://cwpc.github.io/knowledge-communication-dead/?otxkey=post-4503">serve the public with knowledge about spiritualism</a> caused him considerable personal suffering. In further elaborating upon spiritualism in 1859, Edmonds described his personal situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been sorely tried, temporally and mentally. I have been excluded from the associations which once made life pleasant to me. I have felt, in the society which I once hoped to adorn, that I was an object marked for avoidance, if not for abhorrence. Courted once, and honored among men, I have been doomed to see the nearest and dearest to me, turn from me with pity, if not disgust. Tolerated, rather than welcomed among my fellows; at an advanced age, and with infirm health, compelled to begin the world again;<a class="otx-link" title="Edmonds-1859 Letters to the New York Tribune on Spiritualism, By" href="http://cwpc.github.io/refs/edmonds-1859-letters-to-the-new-york-tribune-on-spiritualism-by/?otxkey=Edmonds-1859&#038;otxrp=p.+12+%28from+I.+Introductory%29">^</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Edmonds could have practiced forms of spiritualism without seeking to serve the public with knowledge about spiritualism. He could have discretely offered his wife’s spirit food and money. He could have burnt incense or candles before an image of her, or placed flowers on her grave. He could have called out to all holy deceased men and women to pray for her soul. Many persons around the world, including highly respected public figures, do such activities today. Edmonds&#8217; encountered harsh criticism and personal contempt not because others found his actions incomprehensible, but because they perceived that Edmonds&#8217; attempts to promote knowledge through spiritualism threatened the public good. Creating through spiritual media new texts from authorities like Francis Bacon and Abraham Lincoln posed much greater risks to public deliberation than non-semantic, personal communion with dead ancestors.</p>
<p>Ideals of public deliberation and the marketplace of ideas are no substitute for historical evidence indicating how public deliberation actually works. Symbolic competition, like competition to sell goods and services, <a class="otx-link" title="Democratic Failure: a Case Study of Domestic Violence" href="http://cwpc.github.io/democratic-failure-domestic-violence/?otxkey=post-8022">can perform badly</a>.</p>
